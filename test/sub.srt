1
00:00:29,133 --> 00:00:30,632
(Today's Handsome Heritage)

2
00:00:30,633 --> 00:00:32,602
(Cultural heritage in South Chungcheong Province)

3
00:00:32,603 --> 00:00:35,941
(Lean and handsome Jae Hyeon appears as a guest.)

4
00:00:35,942 --> 00:00:37,871
(He decided on his team members before coming.)

5
00:00:37,872 --> 00:00:39,242
(Reattempt cards)

6
00:00:39,243 --> 00:00:40,682
(Jae Hyeon picks Team Old Boy Handsome in high spirits.)

7
00:00:40,683 --> 00:00:41,942
(Acting like they already won)

8
00:00:41,943 --> 00:00:43,282
(Identification card, 30-minute nap card...)

9
00:00:43,283 --> 00:00:44,451
(Team Young Boy Guys without reattempt cards)

10
00:00:44,452 --> 00:00:45,452
(Jealous)

11
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:47,482
(Reattempt cards with power?)

12
00:00:47,483 --> 00:00:49,721
(We'll win the bingo no matter what.)

13
00:00:49,722 --> 00:00:52,651
(The spot in Cheonan)

14
00:00:52,652 --> 00:00:54,491
(The spot in Cheonan is here?)

15
00:00:54,492 --> 00:00:57,931
(The war starts right away.)

16
00:00:57,932 --> 00:00:59,692
(Team Handsome gets ahead thanks to quick Jae Hyeon.)

17
00:00:59,693 --> 00:01:02,432
(Team Handsome gets ahead thanks to quick Jae Hyeon.)

18
00:01:03,502 --> 00:01:05,773
(However, they aren't good at quizzes.)

19
00:01:06,072 --> 00:01:08,571
(Reattempt card)

20
00:01:08,572 --> 00:01:10,102
(Using a reattempt card right away)

21
00:01:11,072 --> 00:01:14,982
(They keep getting wrong answers.)

22
00:01:14,983 --> 00:01:17,881
(They use up all the reattempt cards and get more stressed out.)

23
00:01:17,882 --> 00:01:19,112
(Reattempt card)

24
00:01:19,113 --> 00:01:20,482
(Our theme for today)

25
00:01:20,483 --> 00:01:22,123
(Team Guys shouts for no stress.)

26
00:01:22,452 --> 00:01:24,492
(Thanks to their positive attitude)

27
00:01:24,693 --> 00:01:25,693
That's correct.

28
00:01:25,694 --> 00:01:29,063
(Smoothly answering correctly)

29
00:01:29,363 --> 00:01:31,062
(Both teams rush over...)

30
00:01:31,063 --> 00:01:33,232
(to Nonsan.)

31
00:01:34,232 --> 00:01:35,862
(During their race towards Nonsan,)

32
00:01:35,863 --> 00:01:38,332
(they arrive before Team Handsome.)

33
00:01:38,333 --> 00:01:41,003
(Team Handsome is no longer in the lead.)

34
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:42,602
That's correct.

35
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:44,241
(Team Guys is unstoppable.)

36
00:01:44,242 --> 00:01:46,742
(Even the birthday girl came into the bakery.)

37
00:01:46,913 --> 00:01:48,813
(Their mission was cleared easily.)

38
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:50,042
(No stress)

39
00:01:51,753 --> 00:01:54,223
(Current score)

40
00:01:54,652 --> 00:01:57,022
(Will Team Guys with no stress win?)

41
00:01:57,023 --> 00:01:58,023
Wait.

42
00:01:58,024 --> 00:01:59,651
Instead of getting lost in joy,

43
00:01:59,652 --> 00:02:00,863
we need to make a plan.

44
00:02:00,923 --> 00:02:01,923
- All right.
- What should we do?

45
00:02:01,923 --> 00:02:02,923
Shall we check their location now?

46
00:02:02,924 --> 00:02:04,091
Let's use the identification card...

47
00:02:04,092 --> 00:02:05,362
to decide our next destination.

48
00:02:05,363 --> 00:02:06,863
- We should find out their location.
- No stress.

49
00:02:07,932 --> 00:02:10,101
(Team Handsome in Cheonan)

50
00:02:10,102 --> 00:02:14,942
(Where did they go after Cheonan?)

51
00:02:14,943 --> 00:02:16,071
We'd like to find out.

52
00:02:16,072 --> 00:02:17,511
We'll use our identification card.

53
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:18,872
We'd like to find out where they are.

54
00:02:19,413 --> 00:02:20,712
- Just leave it.
- Leave it?

55
00:02:21,482 --> 00:02:22,512
The message is here.

56
00:02:24,152 --> 00:02:25,282
(Team Handsome at Buyeo National Museum)

57
00:02:25,283 --> 00:02:26,381
- Gosh.
- They arrived.

58
00:02:26,382 --> 00:02:28,351
They're inside the museum.

59
00:02:28,352 --> 00:02:29,381
- See that?
- Where?

60
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:30,491
Gilt-bronze Incense Burner. Wait.

61
00:02:30,492 --> 00:02:31,553
They're at Buyeo A.

62
00:02:31,992 --> 00:02:33,122
- A?
- Yes.

63
00:02:33,393 --> 00:02:34,492
We need to go now.

64
00:02:34,962 --> 00:02:35,991
- Right now...
- In this case,

65
00:02:35,992 --> 00:02:37,132
we should go to Seosan.

66
00:02:37,133 --> 00:02:39,132
(Seosan: Rock-Carved Triad Buddha)

67
00:02:39,133 --> 00:02:41,462
They can block us and win this square at the same time.

68
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:43,772
- We need to block Seosan.
- You're right.

69
00:02:43,773 --> 00:02:44,832
(Blocking each other's bingo)

70
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:45,833
This is what happened.

71
00:02:45,834 --> 00:02:47,901
So it's about who wins the most again, right?

72
00:02:47,902 --> 00:02:48,902
(Entering a long match)

73
00:02:48,903 --> 00:02:50,871
Seosan is right here.

74
00:02:50,872 --> 00:02:52,013
We can go to Buyeo B.

75
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:54,942
- Why?
- After Buyeo B...

76
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:57,182
- We shouldn't go to Buyeo B.
- No?

77
00:02:57,383 --> 00:02:58,612
- Here's why.
- If we go there,

78
00:02:58,613 --> 00:03:00,311
they would get so angry.

79
00:03:00,312 --> 00:03:02,082
Sang Uk, we have to go to Seosan no matter what.

80
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:03,721
- We do?
- We aren't in a hurry,

81
00:03:03,722 --> 00:03:05,152
but we should go to Seosan now.

82
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:06,922
Can you search Seosan?

83
00:03:06,923 --> 00:03:08,061
Goodbye.

84
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:09,423
- Thank you.
- Have a good day.

85
00:03:09,793 --> 00:03:10,961
(After wishing happy birthday and coming up with a plan)

86
00:03:10,962 --> 00:03:12,061
I'll drive.

87
00:03:12,062 --> 00:03:13,691
No, I'm okay for now.

88
00:03:13,692 --> 00:03:15,263
- But we're going to Seosan.
- It's okay.

89
00:03:16,162 --> 00:03:20,133
(Team Guys sets off to Seosan.)

90
00:03:20,673 --> 00:03:24,773
(But why are we going to Seosan?)

91
00:03:24,972 --> 00:03:26,311
No stress,

92
00:03:26,312 --> 00:03:27,682
but I got stressed out earlier.

93
00:03:28,543 --> 00:03:30,552
I got very stressed out when we mentioned Buyeo B.

94
00:03:30,553 --> 00:03:32,383
I still don't understand.

95
00:03:33,483 --> 00:03:36,251
Wasn't it worth it to consider my suggestion?

96
00:03:36,252 --> 00:03:37,893
No, not at all. That's why I was startled.

97
00:03:38,023 --> 00:03:40,052
Sang Uk, I'll explain again.

98
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,061
- I'll make it simple.
- Okay.

99
00:03:41,062 --> 00:03:43,022
Now that they won Buyeo A,

100
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:44,491
our bingo line is broken.

101
00:03:44,492 --> 00:03:45,492
- Right?
- Yes.

102
00:03:45,763 --> 00:03:48,662
Let's say that we go to Buyeo B now.

103
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:50,161
Think about the time we will spend...

104
00:03:50,162 --> 00:03:51,802
on taking the quiz and eating food...

105
00:03:51,803 --> 00:03:53,401
even if it's a dessert.

106
00:03:53,402 --> 00:03:55,043
Once the other team wins Buyeo A,

107
00:03:55,242 --> 00:03:57,042
only Seosan will remain.

108
00:03:57,043 --> 00:03:58,912
- They would go up.
- Once they get there, it's over.

109
00:03:59,173 --> 00:04:00,582
Then we'll be stressed out from then on.

110
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:01,583
I see.

111
00:04:01,584 --> 00:04:03,612
If they shampoo their hair and sleep...

112
00:04:03,613 --> 00:04:05,552
We wouldn't even get stressed out...

113
00:04:05,553 --> 00:04:07,083
because we'd lose.

114
00:04:07,383 --> 00:04:08,422
- I mean...
- Defeat.

115
00:04:08,423 --> 00:04:09,552
Even if they shampoo their hair and take a nap,

116
00:04:09,553 --> 00:04:10,823
would we still be behind?

117
00:04:10,992 --> 00:04:13,621
We don't need to take those risks.

118
00:04:13,622 --> 00:04:14,823
- Right.
- We don't?

119
00:04:15,122 --> 00:04:18,061
By 12pm, we occupied 2 squares...

120
00:04:18,062 --> 00:04:19,962
and cleared all our missions.

121
00:04:20,662 --> 00:04:22,102
No one has done it faster than us.

122
00:04:22,103 --> 00:04:23,501
That was amazing.

123
00:04:23,502 --> 00:04:25,172
Even the birthday person came in...

124
00:04:25,173 --> 00:04:26,902
so that we could congratulate her.

125
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:30,572
I'm curious about the next step. After Seosan...

126
00:04:30,573 --> 00:04:31,911
If we come back down,

127
00:04:31,912 --> 00:04:33,642
we'll have to drive another 100km.

128
00:04:33,643 --> 00:04:34,643
Right.

129
00:04:34,643 --> 00:04:35,643
(From Seosan to Buyeo B)

130
00:04:35,644 --> 00:04:36,781
- Yi Kyung.
- I'll drive later.

131
00:04:36,782 --> 00:04:38,553
- No stress.
- Right, no stress.

132
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:40,312
You didn't get stressed out just now, right?

133
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:42,323
No, I got stressed out about Buyeo B.

134
00:04:42,722 --> 00:04:44,122
(He's tired of hearing it.)

135
00:04:44,123 --> 00:04:45,692
While making plans,

136
00:04:45,693 --> 00:04:47,091
one of us kept saying, "What about Buyeo B?"

137
00:04:47,092 --> 00:04:48,193
Apologize to me now.

138
00:04:48,763 --> 00:04:50,222
All right.

139
00:04:51,032 --> 00:04:53,192
Hey, why would you apologize?

140
00:04:53,193 --> 00:04:54,702
I said it with a lingering feeling.

141
00:04:54,703 --> 00:04:56,302
Buyeo B, apologize.

142
00:04:56,503 --> 00:04:57,503
Buyeo B.

143
00:04:57,504 --> 00:04:59,503
It was very difficult. The opposing team...

144
00:05:00,172 --> 00:05:02,171
(Cuckoo)

145
00:05:02,172 --> 00:05:03,243
Buyeo A.

146
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:04,611
- Buyeo A.
- Buyeo A.

147
00:05:04,612 --> 00:05:05,712
Okay, Buyeo A.

148
00:05:06,112 --> 00:05:07,281
(Disappointed)

149
00:05:07,282 --> 00:05:08,542
Buyeo A? Okay.

150
00:05:09,383 --> 00:05:12,012
They will either go to Buyeo B or go north.

151
00:05:12,013 --> 00:05:13,182
(Seosan or Buyeo B)

152
00:05:13,183 --> 00:05:14,682
They'll probably win Buyeo B.

153
00:05:14,683 --> 00:05:16,351
(From Buyeo A to Buyeo B)

154
00:05:16,352 --> 00:05:19,792
While expecting us to block Seosan, they'll go to Buyeo B?

155
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:23,092
(Team Handsome)

156
00:05:23,493 --> 00:05:25,292
Should we go directly to Seosan?

157
00:05:25,393 --> 00:05:26,531
Look, Tae Hyun.

158
00:05:26,532 --> 00:05:28,332
- By the way...
- We need to think carefully.

159
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:31,231
Aren't they 100 percent likely to go to Seosan?

160
00:05:31,232 --> 00:05:33,332
They're probably on their way there.

161
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,772
(Dong Hyun is sure that they're on their way to block Seosan.)

162
00:05:34,773 --> 00:05:35,901
I'm 100 percent sure.

163
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:37,101
I think it's all or nothing.

164
00:05:37,102 --> 00:05:38,671
(Jae Hyeon wants to head to Seosan and win.)

165
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:41,981
Now that they're notified,

166
00:05:41,982 --> 00:05:44,583
they'll probably put us to sleep.

167
00:05:44,782 --> 00:05:45,812
(7 minutes from Buyeo A to B)

168
00:05:45,813 --> 00:05:48,082
Tae Hyun, it only takes seven minutes to get there.

169
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:49,282
What do you think about Buyeo B?

170
00:05:49,552 --> 00:05:51,092
- Buyeo B?
- Yes.

171
00:05:51,323 --> 00:05:53,091
Okay, we'll go to Buyeo B.

172
00:05:53,092 --> 00:05:54,693
- All right. Buyeo B?
- Yes.

173
00:05:55,962 --> 00:05:58,361
If the other team is in Buyeo B,

174
00:05:58,362 --> 00:06:01,102
we should go directly to Seosan.

175
00:06:01,433 --> 00:06:03,462
Then bingo will be completed.

176
00:06:04,433 --> 00:06:05,433
All right.

177
00:06:05,434 --> 00:06:06,632
(Dong Hyun came back from the convenience store.)

178
00:06:06,633 --> 00:06:07,772
- Can we eat on our way?
- Yes.

179
00:06:07,773 --> 00:06:08,902
Can I give this to you?

180
00:06:08,972 --> 00:06:12,041
If they came to Buyeo,

181
00:06:12,042 --> 00:06:13,841
they probably would go to Buyeo A.

182
00:06:13,842 --> 00:06:15,312
Right? We'll find out over there.

183
00:06:15,313 --> 00:06:16,482
We'll find out once we get there.

184
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:18,512
Put your seatbelt on.

185
00:06:18,513 --> 00:06:20,623
(They head to check Buyeo B.)

186
00:06:21,222 --> 00:06:22,253
Tae Hyun.

187
00:06:22,422 --> 00:06:24,692
- There are two types.
- Gosh.

188
00:06:24,693 --> 00:06:27,323
- Thank you. It's warm latte.
- Here you go.

189
00:06:27,493 --> 00:06:29,091
(Anything is good for Tae Hyun who's in a hurry.)

190
00:06:29,092 --> 00:06:30,523
I'll put it right here.

191
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:34,433
(They finish the eating mission instantly.)

192
00:06:34,763 --> 00:06:36,101
(They arrive quickly.)

193
00:06:36,102 --> 00:06:37,162
It's nearby.

194
00:06:37,773 --> 00:06:39,433
We could have walked here.

195
00:06:40,102 --> 00:06:41,541
Is their car here?

196
00:06:41,542 --> 00:06:42,542
(Looking around)

197
00:06:42,703 --> 00:06:44,041
What?

198
00:06:44,042 --> 00:06:46,112
(Please be here, guys.)

199
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:47,712
Are they not here?

200
00:06:47,982 --> 00:06:49,042
You don't see their car, do you?

201
00:06:49,513 --> 00:06:50,782
- They're not here.
- No.

202
00:06:50,883 --> 00:06:52,352
They probably didn't come here.

203
00:06:52,513 --> 00:06:55,551
It means that they never planned to come to Buyeo.

204
00:06:55,552 --> 00:06:56,982
(The second location in Buyeo is up to Team Handsome.)

205
00:06:58,023 --> 00:06:59,122
Gosh, what a waste.

206
00:06:59,123 --> 00:07:02,393
Dong Hyun, you got the correct answer in the end.

207
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:03,993
That's for sure.

208
00:07:05,763 --> 00:07:07,962
Both my shoulders and lower back feel stiff.

209
00:07:08,433 --> 00:07:09,902
If we get it right answer this time,

210
00:07:10,063 --> 00:07:11,132
you'll feel recovered.

211
00:07:11,133 --> 00:07:12,302
- Of course.
- Yes.

212
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:14,101
It's over there.

213
00:07:14,102 --> 00:07:15,273
So that's it.

214
00:07:15,972 --> 00:07:17,042
There it is.

215
00:07:17,273 --> 00:07:19,873
They made it very big. It's huge.

216
00:07:21,013 --> 00:07:25,782
(There's a high and mysterious stone tower.)

217
00:07:26,683 --> 00:07:29,722
(Five-Story Stone Pagoda)

218
00:07:29,823 --> 00:07:32,652
(Handsome Heritage 3: The Last Days of Baekje)

219
00:07:32,922 --> 00:07:34,422
It must be him.

220
00:07:34,563 --> 00:07:35,763
Hello.

221
00:07:35,792 --> 00:07:38,361
- Hello. Goodness.
- Goodness.

222
00:07:38,362 --> 00:07:40,592
- The ice has melted.
- I see the path ahead of us.

223
00:07:41,362 --> 00:07:42,662
It's covered with mud.

224
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:45,502
- It's mud.
- We're already in the mud.

225
00:07:45,503 --> 00:07:46,633
It's the path ahead of us.

226
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:48,742
- Hello. It's him again.
- Hello.

227
00:07:48,743 --> 00:07:49,801
(Surprised)

228
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:50,842
- Hello.
- What?

229
00:07:51,013 --> 00:07:52,671
Are you in charge of two locations?

230
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:53,772
(Professor Kim Jae Won they met in the morning)

231
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:55,481
Do you know what this place is?

232
00:07:55,482 --> 00:07:57,312
I saw that it's called Jeongnimsa Temple.

233
00:07:57,313 --> 00:07:58,982
There's a famous stone pagoda here.

234
00:07:59,852 --> 00:08:03,582
Behind you is Five-Story Stone Pagoda at Jeongnimsa Temple.

235
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,651
This is the site for Jeongnimsa Temple,

236
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,721
which is where the name comes from.

237
00:08:07,722 --> 00:08:09,791
Was it Jeongnimsa Temple in the past?

238
00:08:09,792 --> 00:08:10,833
That's right.

239
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:13,062
- Gosh, it's huge.
- Isn't it enormous?

240
00:08:13,063 --> 00:08:16,362
- Yes.
- The location is very important.

241
00:08:16,933 --> 00:08:19,073
It's at the center of Baekje's capital city.

242
00:08:19,672 --> 00:08:20,842
Right at the center.

243
00:08:21,003 --> 00:08:23,772
The midpoint of the straight road is...

244
00:08:23,773 --> 00:08:25,273
right here.

245
00:08:25,712 --> 00:08:30,612
(Jeongnimsa Temple was in the middle of the capital city.)

246
00:08:30,683 --> 00:08:32,981
To explain about Jeongnimsa Temple,

247
00:08:32,982 --> 00:08:35,981
I need to talk...

248
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:37,493
about the history of Baekje.

249
00:08:37,623 --> 00:08:39,791
What was the first capital city of Baekje?

250
00:08:39,792 --> 00:08:40,922
The first capital city was...

251
00:08:41,493 --> 00:08:42,493
It's nearby.

252
00:08:42,494 --> 00:08:43,921
Nearby? No way.

253
00:08:43,922 --> 00:08:44,932
It's very far...

254
00:08:44,933 --> 00:08:46,962
- Baekje's capital city...
- from here.

255
00:08:47,032 --> 00:08:48,133
I forgot.

256
00:08:48,933 --> 00:08:50,102
It's Gangnam.

257
00:08:50,302 --> 00:08:52,901
- Gangnam? Really?
- Gangnam in Seoul.

258
00:08:52,902 --> 00:08:54,072
- Mongchontoseong.
- Right.

259
00:08:54,073 --> 00:08:55,242
That was Baekje's...

260
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:57,102
It's predicted to be the first capital city...

261
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:59,642
- of Baekje.
- Really?

262
00:08:59,643 --> 00:09:01,811
That was the first capital city.

263
00:09:01,812 --> 00:09:04,812
Up until then, Baekje was a prosperous kingdom.

264
00:09:04,883 --> 00:09:06,581
- The capital was up north.
- It was quite big.

265
00:09:06,582 --> 00:09:07,781
It was very big,

266
00:09:07,782 --> 00:09:09,753
Baekje had a lot of national strength...

267
00:09:10,253 --> 00:09:12,092
that could compare to Goguryeo.

268
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:14,822
The most important reason is their diplomacy.

269
00:09:15,093 --> 00:09:16,363
That's right.

270
00:09:16,792 --> 00:09:18,632
You must be aware of it.

271
00:09:18,633 --> 00:09:20,532
Yes, when it comes to diplomacy...

272
00:09:20,763 --> 00:09:22,762
It was good at being diplomatic.

273
00:09:22,763 --> 00:09:24,572
Then a war against Goguryeo got started.

274
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:27,672
In a way, Baekje was unlucky with the opponents.

275
00:09:28,072 --> 00:09:30,541
- I see.
- At that time,

276
00:09:30,542 --> 00:09:33,441
a famous king was born in Goguryeo.

277
00:09:33,442 --> 00:09:35,642
- Gwanggaeto the Great.
- Yes, that's correct.

278
00:09:35,643 --> 00:09:39,311
After facing Gwanggaeto the Great, Baekje started to wither.

279
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:43,682
Under King Jangsu's reign, Goguryeo took over the Han River.

280
00:09:43,853 --> 00:09:46,051
Baekje was kicked out.

281
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:49,523
We can say that Baekje was in ruins at this time.

282
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:52,392
About 60 years have passed.

283
00:09:52,393 --> 00:09:56,201
Suddenly, a famous king faced a renaissance.

284
00:09:56,202 --> 00:10:00,202
King Seong, the son of King Muryeong,

285
00:10:00,302 --> 00:10:02,973
suggested moving.

286
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:07,071
- That's how Sabi was chosen.
- Sabi.

287
00:10:07,072 --> 00:10:09,312
(Changing the capital to Sabi in 583, which is now Buyeo)

288
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:11,352
It was where...

289
00:10:11,353 --> 00:10:14,822
Baekje was revitalized.

290
00:10:15,082 --> 00:10:18,192
- Let's take a look at the pagoda.
- Sure.

291
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:21,222
Has it not changed at all since then?

292
00:10:21,223 --> 00:10:22,463
The pagoda hasn't changed.

293
00:10:23,292 --> 00:10:26,093
Only two stone pagodas from Baekje remain.

294
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:27,863
This is one of them.

295
00:10:28,832 --> 00:10:29,963
This is so impressive.

296
00:10:31,432 --> 00:10:32,503
It's been 1,000 years.

297
00:10:33,672 --> 00:10:34,701
(Five-Story Stone Pagoda at Jeongnimsa Temple)

298
00:10:34,702 --> 00:10:38,213
It's a pagoda made with stone.

299
00:10:39,213 --> 00:10:42,181
Do you notice anything strange in the shape?

300
00:10:42,182 --> 00:10:43,582
- In the shape?
- Yes.

301
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:45,352
Isn't this how it's usually shaped?

302
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:47,311
- The ends are...
- Right.

303
00:10:47,312 --> 00:10:48,482
(Underneath the eave is pointing up.)

304
00:10:48,483 --> 00:10:49,623
What's the difference?

305
00:10:50,082 --> 00:10:52,552
As a stone pagoda, this is quite big.

306
00:10:52,853 --> 00:10:54,993
- The size?
- It's very big.

307
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:59,061
Also, the shape... Can you name a pagoda...

308
00:10:59,062 --> 00:11:00,691
that you're familiar with?

309
00:11:00,692 --> 00:11:02,331
- Dabotap.
- Dabotap.

310
00:11:02,332 --> 00:11:03,462
- Seokgatap.
- Seokgatap.

311
00:11:03,463 --> 00:11:04,531
Those are a few.

312
00:11:04,532 --> 00:11:07,202
This was built earlier than those.

313
00:11:07,402 --> 00:11:09,973
Based on its shape,

314
00:11:10,373 --> 00:11:12,072
it's been influenced by wooden pagodas.

315
00:11:12,812 --> 00:11:17,213
After seeing wooden pagodas in China,

316
00:11:17,442 --> 00:11:19,911
they thought of making one with stone.

317
00:11:19,912 --> 00:11:22,551
That's why it looks like something...

318
00:11:22,552 --> 00:11:25,353
in between a stone pagoda and a wooden pagoda.

319
00:11:25,753 --> 00:11:28,022
After the fall of Baekje,

320
00:11:28,023 --> 00:11:30,962
this is one of the very few pagodas...

321
00:11:30,963 --> 00:11:33,232
from Baekje that remain now.

322
00:11:33,233 --> 00:11:36,162
It's a very precious cultural heritage.

323
00:11:37,932 --> 00:11:39,701
There are only a few.

324
00:11:39,702 --> 00:11:41,541
Making the ends like this...

325
00:11:41,542 --> 00:11:43,003
with stone isn't easy.

326
00:11:43,343 --> 00:11:44,873
- How did they build it?
- I know.

327
00:11:45,473 --> 00:11:47,142
(Buyeo B: Five-Story Stone Pagoda at Jeongnimsa Temple)

328
00:11:47,143 --> 00:11:48,441
Please, let's get one more question.

329
00:11:48,442 --> 00:11:50,442
(Time for Quiz)

330
00:11:51,812 --> 00:11:53,081
During the Baekje period...

331
00:11:53,082 --> 00:11:54,822
- What? Baekje period?
- Yes.

332
00:11:55,353 --> 00:11:57,451
During the Baekje period, paper was rare.

333
00:11:57,452 --> 00:11:59,022
- What was rare?
- Paper.

334
00:11:59,023 --> 00:12:00,352
- Paper?
- Yes, paper was rare.

335
00:12:00,353 --> 00:12:01,893
We have to listen carefully.

336
00:12:01,963 --> 00:12:04,762
Mokgan was often used,

337
00:12:04,763 --> 00:12:07,093
which is writing on a piece of wood.

338
00:12:08,763 --> 00:12:10,331
I saw this.

339
00:12:10,332 --> 00:12:11,873
Me too. I remember it.

340
00:12:12,503 --> 00:12:14,742
The mokgan in the photo was found...

341
00:12:14,743 --> 00:12:17,272
- We saw it earlier.
- on the site in Sabi...

342
00:12:17,273 --> 00:12:18,342
in 2011.

343
00:12:18,343 --> 00:12:21,442
It was made to study this. What could it be?

344
00:12:22,412 --> 00:12:24,383
How is this possible?

345
00:12:24,483 --> 00:12:26,382
- I know the answer.
- We won.

346
00:12:26,383 --> 00:12:27,551
Wait a minute.

347
00:12:27,552 --> 00:12:29,522
Why does it always happen...

348
00:12:29,523 --> 00:12:30,853
when we don't have any reattempt cards?

349
00:12:30,922 --> 00:12:34,522
- Shall we answer it simultaneously?
- Shall we?

350
00:12:34,523 --> 00:12:36,722
We weren't being filmed at that time.

351
00:12:36,723 --> 00:12:38,092
- Right.
- We weren't being filmed.

352
00:12:38,093 --> 00:12:39,362
- Really?
- We weren't.

353
00:12:39,363 --> 00:12:40,832
- We just...
- The curator told us.

354
00:12:41,103 --> 00:12:44,503
(1 hour ago at Buyeo National Museum)

355
00:12:44,633 --> 00:12:48,103
I know them all. King Seong, King Beop,

356
00:12:48,702 --> 00:12:50,643
King Hye, King Mu, and King Uija.

357
00:12:51,042 --> 00:12:52,072
What's this?

358
00:12:52,713 --> 00:12:54,213
It's multiplication table mokgan.

359
00:12:54,682 --> 00:12:55,883
- What?
- Multiplication table.

360
00:12:56,082 --> 00:12:58,713
Such relics were found in Buyeo.

361
00:12:58,983 --> 00:13:00,952
During Baekje before the year 1400.

362
00:13:01,082 --> 00:13:02,082
Why?

363
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:03,222
They show that...

364
00:13:03,223 --> 00:13:06,622
people knew numbers and multiplication back then.

365
00:13:06,623 --> 00:13:07,821
(Did they memorize this back then?)

366
00:13:07,822 --> 00:13:09,763
Did they memorize this back then?

367
00:13:10,763 --> 00:13:13,932
(Winner Team Handsome is bound to win.)

368
00:13:14,192 --> 00:13:16,132
(Shall we say it in the count of three?)

369
00:13:16,133 --> 00:13:18,571
- Why did this come up when...
- By the way,

370
00:13:18,572 --> 00:13:19,831
are you sure?

371
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:21,002
- I'm sure.
- Tae Hyun.

372
00:13:21,003 --> 00:13:22,373
Let's take a look.

373
00:13:22,542 --> 00:13:23,773
Are you sure?

374
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:26,142
It was written on the others next to it.

375
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,242
Weren't there three of them?

376
00:13:27,243 --> 00:13:29,281
- Yes.
- It was written on here.

377
00:13:29,282 --> 00:13:30,941
- Were they the same?
- Yes.

378
00:13:30,942 --> 00:13:32,051
- Okay, that works.
- Tae Hyun.

379
00:13:32,052 --> 00:13:34,383
- One, two, three. Multiplication.
- One, two, three. Multiplication.

380
00:13:35,652 --> 00:13:36,652
Correct.

381
00:13:37,853 --> 00:13:40,451
What did I tell you? This is so odd.

382
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:41,763
When there's no reattempt card,

383
00:13:42,093 --> 00:13:45,133
the brain pulls all the resources from the universe.

384
00:13:45,993 --> 00:13:47,031
Let's see.

385
00:13:47,032 --> 00:13:49,901
- When you look at the front of it, - Right.

386
00:13:49,902 --> 00:13:52,873
it's faint but written in ink.

387
00:13:53,072 --> 00:13:54,401
What you saw earlier...

388
00:13:54,402 --> 00:13:58,243
had been restored with infrared.

389
00:14:00,273 --> 00:14:01,482
I read all of it.

390
00:14:01,483 --> 00:14:02,642
It starts from multiples of nine.

391
00:14:02,643 --> 00:14:03,882
- Where?
- Multiples of nine.

392
00:14:03,883 --> 00:14:05,983
Nine times nine is eighty-one. Seven times nine is sixty-three.

393
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:09,922
(A long-standing tradition of private education)

394
00:14:10,107 --> 00:14:11,636
From multiples of nine from the top...

395
00:14:11,637 --> 00:14:14,675
- Right.
- If we didn't hear...

396
00:14:14,676 --> 00:14:16,445
his explanation,

397
00:14:16,446 --> 00:14:18,276
- it was impossible to answer it.
- Right.

398
00:14:18,546 --> 00:14:19,876
Multiplication table. One, two.

399
00:14:19,877 --> 00:14:21,887
- Multiplication table.
- Multiplication table.

400
00:14:23,286 --> 00:14:24,415
Tae Hyun.

401
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:26,016
(Buyeo B: Five-Story Stone Pagoda at Jeongnimsa Temple)

402
00:14:26,017 --> 00:14:27,686
I feel amazing now.

403
00:14:27,757 --> 00:14:31,325
I can't believe the question was on something that we saw.

404
00:14:31,326 --> 00:14:33,195
Without the reattempt card,

405
00:14:33,196 --> 00:14:35,566
you were very careful when listening to the question.

406
00:14:36,426 --> 00:14:37,566
I feel so good.

407
00:14:38,196 --> 00:14:40,597
- Unbelievable.
- Thank you.

408
00:14:41,367 --> 00:14:42,806
It's lotus leaf rice set meal.

409
00:14:43,467 --> 00:14:45,376
- Let's order only one.
- Okay.

410
00:14:45,377 --> 00:14:46,936
Okay, we don't have much time.

411
00:14:47,036 --> 00:14:48,476
We already won three.

412
00:14:48,477 --> 00:14:50,205
- Right, we only need one.
- Wait.

413
00:14:50,206 --> 00:14:52,147
If they don't take away Asan and Yesan...

414
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:54,445
They won't get the bingo.

415
00:14:54,446 --> 00:14:56,517
- We can also go to Seosan.
- What should we do?

416
00:14:56,717 --> 00:14:57,846
Let's eat first.

417
00:14:57,847 --> 00:14:59,655
We have to take a nap and wash our hair.

418
00:14:59,656 --> 00:15:01,055
- Let's get going.
- Let's go.

419
00:15:01,056 --> 00:15:02,887
Let's go to the restaurant first.

420
00:15:03,587 --> 00:15:05,226
(Team Guys)

421
00:15:05,227 --> 00:15:07,357
We traveled far, and we're almost at Seosan.

422
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:08,925
Seosan is important.

423
00:15:08,926 --> 00:15:10,565
It will be difficult for us if we don't get Seosan.

424
00:15:10,566 --> 00:15:12,267
We will lose our confidence.

425
00:15:13,637 --> 00:15:15,607
Seosan is the most important spot.

426
00:15:15,637 --> 00:15:17,137
- For both teams.
- Yes.

427
00:15:18,377 --> 00:15:20,136
(Seung Ho notices something at the entrance.)

428
00:15:20,137 --> 00:15:21,806
Gosh, there it is.

429
00:15:22,147 --> 00:15:24,075
He looks very mischievous.

430
00:15:24,076 --> 00:15:25,717
I don't know if I can say this.

431
00:15:25,946 --> 00:15:27,275
Who does?

432
00:15:27,276 --> 00:15:30,686
The middle Buddha statue of Rock-Carved Triad Buddha.

433
00:15:30,987 --> 00:15:33,486
He looks very mischievous. I just saw a photo.

434
00:15:33,487 --> 00:15:35,727
A photo? I thought you could actually see it.

435
00:15:37,826 --> 00:15:39,726
- We're here.
- That was perfect.

436
00:15:39,727 --> 00:15:41,097
Thank you for driving.

437
00:15:41,156 --> 00:15:43,666
We have to get to the other side.

438
00:15:44,367 --> 00:15:46,737
We do? You're right.

439
00:15:48,767 --> 00:15:50,565
This is a hiking special.

440
00:15:50,566 --> 00:15:53,706
There's tourist information on Rock-Carved Triad Buddha.

441
00:15:53,906 --> 00:15:55,805
- The entrance is free.
- You're right.

442
00:15:55,806 --> 00:15:58,117
It's called Seosan City Culture Facilities Administer Office.

443
00:15:58,347 --> 00:16:00,477
National Treasure Number 84.

444
00:16:00,576 --> 00:16:03,945
(Tourist Information on Rock-Carved Triad Buddha)

445
00:16:03,946 --> 00:16:04,986
I see why you called him mischievous.

446
00:16:04,987 --> 00:16:06,017
- I just saw it.
- Right?

447
00:16:06,217 --> 00:16:08,086
Doesn't he look slightly mischievous?

448
00:16:08,087 --> 00:16:09,726
(They hurry over to the Buddha statue that looks mischievous.)

449
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:12,256
- Mischievous?
- Mischievous.

450
00:16:12,257 --> 00:16:13,656
I'll take a look up there.

451
00:16:13,857 --> 00:16:16,266
(Magnificent features of the mountain come into view.)

452
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:17,666
The view is beautiful.

453
00:16:18,397 --> 00:16:20,195
(The end of the uphill seems far away.)

454
00:16:20,196 --> 00:16:21,637
It's very steep.

455
00:16:22,306 --> 00:16:23,936
Be careful not to slip.

456
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:26,805
The energy of victory...

457
00:16:26,806 --> 00:16:28,505
and hunger.

458
00:16:28,506 --> 00:16:29,776
I feel them at the same time.

459
00:16:29,777 --> 00:16:31,617
(Panting)

460
00:16:32,446 --> 00:16:33,616
"My enthusiasm..."

461
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:36,147
She's waiting for us.

462
00:16:36,617 --> 00:16:37,886
- Here we are.
- Hello.

463
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,185
- We might get it wrong.
- Hello.

464
00:16:39,186 --> 00:16:41,726
- Hello, nice to meet you.
- Hello.

465
00:16:42,587 --> 00:16:45,526
We traveled far to see Rock-Carved Triad Buddha.

466
00:16:45,527 --> 00:16:47,255
Could you explain what it is?

467
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:50,566
First, we're standing in front of The Gate of Non-Duality.

468
00:16:50,567 --> 00:16:51,995
- "The Gate of Non-Duality?" - Yes.

469
00:16:51,996 --> 00:16:53,936
The Gate of Non-Duality indicates...

470
00:16:54,037 --> 00:16:55,405
that this world is before the gate.

471
00:16:55,406 --> 00:16:58,107
Beyond that gate is the world of Buddha.

472
00:16:58,637 --> 00:17:01,005
It means that we're one with Buddha.

473
00:17:01,006 --> 00:17:04,146
The truth is 1, not 2.

474
00:17:04,147 --> 00:17:05,745
(The Gate of Non-Duality, located between this world...)

475
00:17:05,746 --> 00:17:07,475
(and the world of Buddha)

476
00:17:07,476 --> 00:17:09,146
Shall we go into the world...

477
00:17:09,147 --> 00:17:10,786
- of Buddha?
- Okay.

478
00:17:10,787 --> 00:17:12,185
Shall we go through the Gate of Non-Duality?

479
00:17:12,186 --> 00:17:14,786
- After the gate, it was written...
- Buyeo A.

480
00:17:14,787 --> 00:17:16,357
Please excuse us, ma'am.

481
00:17:17,057 --> 00:17:18,656
How did they get it so quickly?

482
00:17:19,426 --> 00:17:21,226
Now that you think about it, shouldn't we have gone there?

483
00:17:22,027 --> 00:17:23,567
What are you talking about? No.

484
00:17:23,597 --> 00:17:25,696
They have to come up, and we must block them.

485
00:17:25,797 --> 00:17:27,236
- Okay.
- Next...

486
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:29,067
we'll win this one.

487
00:17:29,567 --> 00:17:31,637
- Let's hurry.
- Let's block them.

488
00:17:31,706 --> 00:17:33,576
- May I take the pamphlet?
- Just take one.

489
00:17:33,577 --> 00:17:34,676
Let's go.

490
00:17:35,077 --> 00:17:37,475
We're in the world of Buddha now.

491
00:17:37,476 --> 00:17:39,147
- Okay.
- From here?

492
00:17:40,277 --> 00:17:44,445
(Handsome Heritage 6, A Smile of 1,000 Years)

493
00:17:44,446 --> 00:17:45,586
We must win this one.

494
00:17:45,587 --> 00:17:47,056
(Panting)

495
00:17:47,057 --> 00:17:48,856
If not, it'll be horrible.

496
00:17:48,857 --> 00:17:50,156
Let's see.

497
00:17:51,226 --> 00:17:53,356
(Rock-Carved Triad Buddha finally appears.)

498
00:17:53,357 --> 00:17:55,695
So this is Rock-Carved Triad Buddha?

499
00:17:55,696 --> 00:17:56,996
You're right.

500
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:00,695
(Rock-Carved Triad Buddha)

501
00:18:00,696 --> 00:18:02,867
- How did they build this?
- Is this the right way?

502
00:18:03,137 --> 00:18:05,636
This is National Treasure Number 84,

503
00:18:05,637 --> 00:18:07,736
Rock-Carved Triad Buddha in Yonghyeon-ri, Seosan.

504
00:18:08,446 --> 00:18:10,146
When most people hear...

505
00:18:10,147 --> 00:18:12,675
that it's a national treasure, they expect it to be enormous.

506
00:18:12,676 --> 00:18:15,317
They're surprised to see how small it is.

507
00:18:15,446 --> 00:18:17,445
After listening to my explanation,

508
00:18:17,446 --> 00:18:21,627
you'll understand why it's the best rock-carved Buddha statue in Korea.

509
00:18:22,087 --> 00:18:23,456
- Please go ahead.
- Sure.

510
00:18:23,887 --> 00:18:25,495
"Maae" means...

511
00:18:25,496 --> 00:18:27,826
carved rock.

512
00:18:27,827 --> 00:18:29,597
(Carved "ma," rock "ae")

513
00:18:30,397 --> 00:18:35,636
(At the end of Baekje, the statue was made by carving out the rock.)

514
00:18:35,637 --> 00:18:39,806
(Then what is Triad Buddha?)

515
00:18:39,807 --> 00:18:43,147
The first one holding a marble is...

516
00:18:43,246 --> 00:18:46,245
Dipankara, one of Buddhas from the past.

517
00:18:46,246 --> 00:18:48,485
(The first among Triad Buddha, Dipankara)

518
00:18:48,486 --> 00:18:50,915
(Helped Gautama Buddha attain Buddhahood)

519
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:52,985
- What is he holding?
- Bongboju.

520
00:18:52,986 --> 00:18:55,356
When you die and enter the underworld,

521
00:18:55,357 --> 00:18:57,255
a marble of this size will pivot...

522
00:18:57,256 --> 00:18:58,756
around the life you led.

523
00:18:59,156 --> 00:19:02,696
- Have you heard of that story?
- It's called bongboju.

524
00:19:05,436 --> 00:19:09,106
(Standing in the middle)

525
00:19:09,107 --> 00:19:10,965
On our way here, Seung Ho looked up the photo...

526
00:19:10,966 --> 00:19:12,837
and said that one of them looked mischievous.

527
00:19:13,476 --> 00:19:15,577
Here's the one who looks mischievous.

528
00:19:16,147 --> 00:19:18,245
(You called me mischievous? That's discourteous.)

529
00:19:18,246 --> 00:19:20,816
It's also known as Smile of Baekje.

530
00:19:20,817 --> 00:19:23,847
Among Buddhas,

531
00:19:23,986 --> 00:19:26,317
Siddhartha Gautama attained Buddhahood.

532
00:19:26,857 --> 00:19:29,456
It means the one who's enlightened.

533
00:19:29,656 --> 00:19:33,156
After becoming Buddha, he will lead the way for the sentient beings.

534
00:19:34,027 --> 00:19:37,896
If there are sentient beings that he missed,

535
00:19:37,897 --> 00:19:40,965
Maitreya will appear after 5.67 billion years.

536
00:19:40,966 --> 00:19:44,235
they will lead the way for the missing sentient beings.

537
00:19:44,236 --> 00:19:47,405
They're Triad Buddha of the past, present, and future.

538
00:19:47,406 --> 00:19:49,475
(Maitreya, Buddha of the future, the savior of sentient beings)

539
00:19:49,476 --> 00:19:51,547
The most significant feature is...

540
00:19:51,877 --> 00:19:53,146
the smile.

541
00:19:53,147 --> 00:19:54,475
- The smile?
- Yes.

542
00:19:54,476 --> 00:19:57,316
Think about it. There's no life to rocks.

543
00:19:57,317 --> 00:20:00,786
Because of the smile, it looks alive.

544
00:20:00,787 --> 00:20:04,155
(Smiling for thousands of years without any change)

545
00:20:04,156 --> 00:20:06,396
From the east at 30 degrees,

546
00:20:06,397 --> 00:20:08,297
it looks the most balanced.

547
00:20:08,766 --> 00:20:11,566
When there's proper sunlight,

548
00:20:11,567 --> 00:20:13,536
its mysterious quality can't be described in words.

549
00:20:13,537 --> 00:20:14,765
(As the facial expression changes, it's more mysterious.)

550
00:20:14,766 --> 00:20:17,235
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Thank you.

551
00:20:17,236 --> 00:20:18,905
Take a careful look at it.

552
00:20:18,906 --> 00:20:21,036
- Okay, thank you.
- Thank you.

553
00:20:21,037 --> 00:20:22,777
- She explained so well.
- Thank you.

554
00:20:23,406 --> 00:20:24,776
Can I read the pamphlet?

555
00:20:24,777 --> 00:20:26,146
Please return it during the quiz.

556
00:20:26,147 --> 00:20:28,347
Then we should read it now.

557
00:20:29,347 --> 00:20:31,287
He won't ask about the shape, will he?

558
00:20:31,756 --> 00:20:33,255
Right, it's in front of us.

559
00:20:33,256 --> 00:20:35,226
It won't come up, right?

560
00:20:35,627 --> 00:20:37,656
- Let's start the quiz.
- Okay.

561
00:20:37,787 --> 00:20:39,027
All right.

562
00:20:40,027 --> 00:20:44,567
You'll be disqualified if you turn around.

563
00:20:45,996 --> 00:20:47,137
Please put it down.

564
00:20:48,367 --> 00:20:51,536
The shape of two hands of the Buddha in the middle...

565
00:20:51,537 --> 00:20:53,436
of Rock-Carved Triad Buddha is different.

566
00:20:55,406 --> 00:21:00,347
The shape on the right means getting rid of all fears of sentient beings.

567
00:21:00,547 --> 00:21:05,986
The shape on the left means granting all wishes of sentient beings.

568
00:21:07,456 --> 00:21:10,286
In the count of three, please make...

569
00:21:10,287 --> 00:21:12,856
the same shape of the Buddha's hands.

570
00:21:12,857 --> 00:21:14,756
You're not allowed to discuss.

571
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:16,627
This is very difficult.

572
00:21:17,027 --> 00:21:19,096
It was shaped like this.

573
00:21:19,097 --> 00:21:20,165
(A question that they never imagined)

574
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:21,636
You aren't allowed to discuss.

575
00:21:21,637 --> 00:21:23,966
(A question that they can't even discuss)

576
00:21:24,607 --> 00:21:26,036
(Flustered by the question about the shape)

577
00:21:26,037 --> 00:21:27,676
Close your eyes and imagine it, Sang Uk.

578
00:21:28,176 --> 00:21:29,647
I didn't look at the hands.

579
00:21:29,706 --> 00:21:31,046
How did they look?

580
00:21:31,047 --> 00:21:32,445
Please think quietly.

581
00:21:32,446 --> 00:21:34,147
- Think quietly.
- How can we think quietly?

582
00:21:34,577 --> 00:21:35,746
This is... Wait.

583
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:40,455
Do we have to guess the fingers too?

584
00:21:40,456 --> 00:21:42,357
Yes, that's the question.

585
00:21:43,127 --> 00:21:44,756
All three of you have to be right.

586
00:21:45,226 --> 00:21:46,696
Guys, I don't know the answer.

587
00:21:47,756 --> 00:21:49,067
Gosh, what was it?

588
00:21:50,327 --> 00:21:52,637
- That's why we can't turn around.
- We lost.

589
00:21:52,996 --> 00:21:55,435
This is all I can think about. I'll go with this.

590
00:21:55,436 --> 00:21:57,436
- Let's just do it.
- All right.

591
00:21:57,867 --> 00:22:00,607
One, two, three.

592
00:22:05,777 --> 00:22:06,945
That's incorrect.

593
00:22:06,946 --> 00:22:08,686
(Incorrect)

594
00:22:09,117 --> 00:22:10,547
Can we take a look now?

595
00:22:11,486 --> 00:22:13,185
What's wrong? Do we get another chance?

596
00:22:13,186 --> 00:22:15,756
I'll give you another chance.

597
00:22:16,087 --> 00:22:18,396
Can we talk about what we did?

598
00:22:18,397 --> 00:22:20,755
You may discuss without turning around.

599
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:22,126
- This was the right hand.
- You have one more chance.

600
00:22:22,127 --> 00:22:23,426
This was my left hand.

601
00:22:24,067 --> 00:22:25,366
This is what I did.

602
00:22:25,367 --> 00:22:26,735
(This is...)

603
00:22:26,736 --> 00:22:28,036
What about you?

604
00:22:28,037 --> 00:22:29,706
That must be wrong. We were all different.

605
00:22:30,137 --> 00:22:31,406
All of us were different.

606
00:22:32,006 --> 00:22:33,735
This is what I remember,

607
00:22:33,736 --> 00:22:35,037
but I don't know about the fingers.

608
00:22:35,676 --> 00:22:37,277
No, this was the right hand.

609
00:22:37,307 --> 00:22:39,516
- It's the opposite.
- Hey. Darn it.

610
00:22:39,716 --> 00:22:41,745
I don't remember the fingers.

611
00:22:41,746 --> 00:22:43,886
Isn't this too much of Spider Man?

612
00:22:43,887 --> 00:22:45,787
Yi Kyung, was this the shape of the right hand?

613
00:22:45,857 --> 00:22:47,485
- This was the right hand.
- Is this correct?

614
00:22:47,486 --> 00:22:48,986
- Yes.
- I'll believe you.

615
00:22:49,087 --> 00:22:50,426
That can't be it.

616
00:22:51,226 --> 00:22:52,357
It can't be it?

617
00:22:52,797 --> 00:22:54,857
- It looks like Spider Man.
- That's totally off.

618
00:22:55,496 --> 00:22:57,397
It's either this or that.

619
00:22:58,226 --> 00:22:59,966
Why do they both look wrong?

620
00:23:05,406 --> 00:23:08,077
You know, my fingers feel very strange.

621
00:23:08,676 --> 00:23:10,675
I don't feel like they belong to me.

622
00:23:10,676 --> 00:23:13,216
- This question is so hard.
- They don't feel like my fingers.

623
00:23:13,647 --> 00:23:15,586
- What's your guess, Sang Uk?
- Mine is this.

624
00:23:15,587 --> 00:23:16,886
- Let's think about it.
- This?

625
00:23:16,887 --> 00:23:18,556
- All fingers are extended?
- It's because...

626
00:23:18,557 --> 00:23:19,715
This is my guess.

627
00:23:19,716 --> 00:23:20,986
This is my guess.

628
00:23:21,256 --> 00:23:22,327
This is mine.

629
00:23:22,726 --> 00:23:24,925
- This?
- I think this is it.

630
00:23:24,926 --> 00:23:26,426
- How about rock-paper-scissors?
- We're all different.

631
00:23:26,827 --> 00:23:28,926
- All our guesses are different.
- Right.

632
00:23:29,766 --> 00:23:32,496
- The answer must be one of these.
- I agree.

633
00:23:32,567 --> 00:23:34,196
Let's do this.

634
00:23:34,236 --> 00:23:35,537
We'll go with mine.

635
00:23:37,236 --> 00:23:38,935
If one of you is correct,

636
00:23:38,936 --> 00:23:40,976
one of you will go home.

637
00:23:41,006 --> 00:23:42,846
- The remaining two will decide.
- If one of us is correct?

638
00:23:42,847 --> 00:23:44,106
- Yes, what do you think?
- If one of us is correct?

639
00:23:44,107 --> 00:23:45,546
- We'll go.
- Okay.

640
00:23:45,547 --> 00:23:48,415
Make the shape of the Buddha's hands.

641
00:23:48,416 --> 00:23:49,847
- We'll go with this.
- One, two, three.

642
00:23:51,956 --> 00:23:53,316
Hold that pose.

643
00:23:53,317 --> 00:23:55,486
Two of you will turn around and check.

644
00:23:55,887 --> 00:23:56,925
This is so...

645
00:23:56,926 --> 00:23:59,096
- Wait, I can't look.
- Wait.

646
00:23:59,097 --> 00:24:00,255
Isn't this a punishment?

647
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:01,695
If we get it wrong,

648
00:24:01,696 --> 00:24:03,897
you should stay like this and become the fourth Buddha.

649
00:24:05,027 --> 00:24:06,297
Two of you, please turn around.

650
00:24:11,837 --> 00:24:13,337
- It's not clear.
- What?

651
00:24:14,637 --> 00:24:15,906
Isn't this it?

652
00:24:17,676 --> 00:24:18,676
May I turn around?

653
00:24:20,047 --> 00:24:21,047
This is it.

654
00:24:21,446 --> 00:24:23,416
- All of us were wrong.
- We were wrong.

655
00:24:24,916 --> 00:24:25,956
Is this it?

656
00:24:26,416 --> 00:24:27,455
Is this it?

657
00:24:27,456 --> 00:24:28,485
- Is this it?
- Yes, that's it.

658
00:24:28,486 --> 00:24:30,287
Hey, we were all wrong.

659
00:24:31,686 --> 00:24:32,695
We were all wrong.

660
00:24:32,696 --> 00:24:33,925
So that's the pose?

661
00:24:33,926 --> 00:24:36,265
(Gosh, you've been mischievous with us.)

662
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:40,036
I didn't even imagine that it would be this pose.

663
00:24:40,037 --> 00:24:41,936
- Seriously.
- I did the pose at one point.

664
00:24:45,037 --> 00:24:46,076
I didn't even imagine it.

665
00:24:46,077 --> 00:24:47,736
- Seriously.
- I did the pose at one point.

666
00:24:47,936 --> 00:24:49,505
If someone had come up with this...

667
00:24:49,506 --> 00:24:51,576
We'd say, "Are you shooting a gun?"

668
00:24:51,577 --> 00:24:52,647
- Right?
- Right.

669
00:24:52,817 --> 00:24:53,945
We were right about this.

670
00:24:53,946 --> 00:24:55,386
Two of them were open.

671
00:24:55,387 --> 00:24:56,715
He kept saying that two were open.

672
00:24:56,716 --> 00:24:58,715
- So this is it.
- When Dong Hyun comes here,

673
00:24:58,716 --> 00:25:00,116
he has more chance of getting it right than us.

674
00:25:00,117 --> 00:25:02,226
He keeps looking for strange details.

675
00:25:03,287 --> 00:25:04,786
We'd better hurry and leave.

676
00:25:04,787 --> 00:25:06,627
They're definitely on their way here.

677
00:25:07,027 --> 00:25:08,597
Yesan A?

678
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:11,327
What if they come to Seosan and get it wrong?

679
00:25:11,567 --> 00:25:13,067
- Then we'll go to Asan.
- And we win Asan.

680
00:25:13,266 --> 00:25:14,336
We have a chance of winning.

681
00:25:14,337 --> 00:25:16,067
They could possibly get it wrong.

682
00:25:16,206 --> 00:25:17,537
- Gosh.
- This was difficult.

683
00:25:18,006 --> 00:25:20,106
I guarantee you that they won't get it right.

684
00:25:20,107 --> 00:25:21,836
The number of fingers that are extended...

685
00:25:21,837 --> 00:25:23,576
This isn't easy. We'll go to Yesan A.

686
00:25:23,577 --> 00:25:24,877
Put them to sleep and go to Asan.

687
00:25:25,006 --> 00:25:26,546
(Team Handsome)

688
00:25:26,547 --> 00:25:27,547
Excuse me.

689
00:25:27,847 --> 00:25:28,945
Can we get...

690
00:25:28,946 --> 00:25:31,317
- Two lotus leaf rice, please.
- two lotus leaf rice?

691
00:25:31,387 --> 00:25:33,685
He will definitely order tteokgalbi.

692
00:25:33,686 --> 00:25:34,956
I'll cover tteokgalbi.

693
00:25:36,287 --> 00:25:38,426
- You're covering...
- We have to do it.

694
00:25:38,696 --> 00:25:39,696
Good job.

695
00:25:39,697 --> 00:25:42,626
Sir, when someone asks about tteokgalbi,

696
00:25:42,627 --> 00:25:44,526
could you tell him that it's sold out?

697
00:25:44,527 --> 00:25:45,965
- I will.
- Thank you.

698
00:25:45,966 --> 00:25:47,066
(He's coming.)

699
00:25:47,067 --> 00:25:48,537
After going to Seosan,

700
00:25:48,706 --> 00:25:49,905
we can head to Asan.

701
00:25:49,906 --> 00:25:51,266
There's only an hour difference.

702
00:25:51,936 --> 00:25:53,706
- We already ordered.
- Okay.

703
00:25:54,607 --> 00:25:57,107
- They only have lotus leaf rice.
- Right.

704
00:25:57,446 --> 00:26:00,316
How is it so famous?

705
00:26:00,317 --> 00:26:01,317
I'm curious.

706
00:26:01,318 --> 00:26:02,847
The restaurant only sells...

707
00:26:03,516 --> 00:26:05,086
lotus leaf rice.

708
00:26:05,087 --> 00:26:06,587
There's nothing to eat other than lotus leaf rice.

709
00:26:07,656 --> 00:26:09,087
- I heard that it was incredible.
- Really?

710
00:26:09,627 --> 00:26:11,787
- I'm curious.
- Don't be curious.

711
00:26:12,156 --> 00:26:13,897
(Giggling)

712
00:26:14,196 --> 00:26:16,097
- There's nothing else on the menu?
- No.

713
00:26:16,266 --> 00:26:17,296
(Laughing)

714
00:26:17,297 --> 00:26:18,866
- There's nothing else on the menu?
- No.

715
00:26:18,867 --> 00:26:20,695
There should be something to go with rice.

716
00:26:20,696 --> 00:26:23,536
There isn't anything.

717
00:26:23,537 --> 00:26:25,067
- There isn't anything.
- What's this?

718
00:26:25,837 --> 00:26:27,306
- There's nothing.
- There's tteokgalbi.

719
00:26:27,307 --> 00:26:30,005
Of course, there's tteokgalbi.

720
00:26:30,006 --> 00:26:31,047
No way.

721
00:26:31,206 --> 00:26:33,915
- It's because...
- It's sold out.

722
00:26:33,916 --> 00:26:36,215
There must be meat to go with lotus leaf rice.

723
00:26:36,216 --> 00:26:37,915
No, forget it.

724
00:26:37,916 --> 00:26:39,356
- What else is there?
- No.

725
00:26:39,357 --> 00:26:41,156
Of course there's something else on the menu.

726
00:26:41,857 --> 00:26:42,956
That's hilarious.

727
00:26:43,287 --> 00:26:44,926
It's okay. I ate a lot earlier.

728
00:26:45,357 --> 00:26:47,526
(Tae Hyun calls someone.)

729
00:26:47,527 --> 00:26:49,225
Who are you calling? The hair salon?

730
00:26:49,226 --> 00:26:50,425
This is the hair salon.

731
00:26:50,426 --> 00:26:52,666
Ma'am, are you open right now?

732
00:26:53,137 --> 00:26:54,736
- Yes.
- How much is it...

733
00:26:54,797 --> 00:26:56,606
to get the hair shampooed?

734
00:26:56,607 --> 00:26:58,235
- Shampooing is ten dollars.
- Shampoo?

735
00:26:58,236 --> 00:26:59,776
Shampooing for ten dollars? Okay.

736
00:26:59,777 --> 00:27:03,547
We'll get there within 15 minutes.

737
00:27:03,746 --> 00:27:05,516
There's someone...

738
00:27:06,377 --> 00:27:07,515
who made a reservation.

739
00:27:07,516 --> 00:27:09,946
While you take care of your client's hair,

740
00:27:10,446 --> 00:27:12,056
can we get our hair shampooed...

741
00:27:12,057 --> 00:27:13,655
I can shampoo your hair.

742
00:27:13,656 --> 00:27:15,117
We also have someone who can shampoo my hair.

743
00:27:15,726 --> 00:27:17,526
- You want to wash yourself?
- Yes.

744
00:27:17,527 --> 00:27:19,226
We can do it ourselves.

745
00:27:19,557 --> 00:27:20,626
It's possible...

746
00:27:20,627 --> 00:27:22,726
as long as you let us use your facility.

747
00:27:23,166 --> 00:27:24,567
Oh, okay.

748
00:27:24,797 --> 00:27:26,735
- Thank you.
- Sure.

749
00:27:26,736 --> 00:27:28,466
- Bye.
- Bye.

750
00:27:28,867 --> 00:27:31,806
(They haven't heard anything from Team Guys.)

751
00:27:31,807 --> 00:27:34,077
They must be heading to Seosan.

752
00:27:34,577 --> 00:27:36,107
They definitely went north.

753
00:27:36,746 --> 00:27:38,107
Considering that they're taking a long time.

754
00:27:38,446 --> 00:27:39,846
In order to block us,

755
00:27:39,847 --> 00:27:42,087
- they have to go to Seosan.
- Exactly.

756
00:27:42,516 --> 00:27:44,215
(The food is finally served.)

757
00:27:44,216 --> 00:27:45,246
By the way...

758
00:27:47,016 --> 00:27:48,557
- There's a lot of food.
- I know.

759
00:27:48,956 --> 00:27:51,057
- Hey.
- Isn't it that?

760
00:27:51,387 --> 00:27:52,426
Freshwater snails.

761
00:27:53,827 --> 00:27:55,666
It's also served with mackerel.

762
00:27:56,097 --> 00:27:57,226
Thank you.

763
00:27:57,327 --> 00:27:58,965
The food is nicely presented.

764
00:27:58,966 --> 00:28:00,036
Food for the well-being.

765
00:28:00,037 --> 00:28:01,465
(Shall we try the lotus leaf rice set meal?)

766
00:28:01,466 --> 00:28:02,735
It's 30 minutes.

767
00:28:02,736 --> 00:28:03,936
- Let's leave in ten minutes.
- Okay.

768
00:28:04,067 --> 00:28:05,067
Thank you for the food.

769
00:28:05,068 --> 00:28:06,206
- Thank you for the food.
- Enjoy.

770
00:28:06,406 --> 00:28:08,577
This is fascinating. It's nicely served.

771
00:28:09,246 --> 00:28:10,346
It's fascinating.

772
00:28:10,347 --> 00:28:13,377
(Opening up the lotus leaf)

773
00:28:14,216 --> 00:28:16,587
(Dong Hyun smells it first.)

774
00:28:17,216 --> 00:28:18,516
The herbal medicine at a sauna...

775
00:28:18,647 --> 00:28:20,786
It has the smell of a sauna.

776
00:28:20,787 --> 00:28:22,016
- Herbal medicine?
- Herbal medicine.

777
00:28:22,527 --> 00:28:23,685
The smell is nice.

778
00:28:23,686 --> 00:28:25,127
It smells healthy.

779
00:28:25,357 --> 00:28:27,696
Why is this neighborhood known for lotus leaves?

780
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:30,066
At the Gungnamji Pond,

781
00:28:30,067 --> 00:28:31,867
about ten million lotus flowers bloom.

782
00:28:31,926 --> 00:28:32,936
(Exclaiming)

783
00:28:33,996 --> 00:28:35,837
Gungnamji Pond in this neighborhood?

784
00:28:37,107 --> 00:28:39,906
(Real and natural lotus flowers)

785
00:28:40,277 --> 00:28:41,736
It's a natural lotus leaf.

786
00:28:42,277 --> 00:28:43,877
- It's glutinous rice.
- Yes.

787
00:28:45,107 --> 00:28:46,646
(Dong Hyun tries the glutinous rice first.)

788
00:28:46,647 --> 00:28:48,316
(The essence of lotus leaf rice)

789
00:28:48,317 --> 00:28:49,646
It's steamed.

790
00:28:49,647 --> 00:28:53,015
(Jae Hyeon also tries a bite.)

791
00:28:53,016 --> 00:28:54,455
- By the way...
- The rice tastes amazing.

792
00:28:54,456 --> 00:28:56,456
Its consistency...

793
00:28:59,857 --> 00:29:02,265
The glutinous rice is chewy.

794
00:29:02,266 --> 00:29:04,027
(Rich in collagen, lotus leaf rice is also good for the skin.)

795
00:29:04,827 --> 00:29:05,897
Dong Hyun.

796
00:29:06,236 --> 00:29:07,296
- Is it good?
- Oh, my.

797
00:29:07,297 --> 00:29:08,567
(The glutinous rice is the best.)

798
00:29:09,006 --> 00:29:10,537
All the side dishes are good too. Awesome.

799
00:29:12,206 --> 00:29:13,506
There are many of my favorite dishes.

800
00:29:14,006 --> 00:29:15,106
Everything tastes so good.

801
00:29:15,107 --> 00:29:16,506
This one is good, too. Try it.

802
00:29:16,607 --> 00:29:17,846
This is amazing.

803
00:29:17,847 --> 00:29:19,016
(Seasoned freshwater snails)

804
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:21,676
(Humming)

805
00:29:23,216 --> 00:29:24,647
(Delicious side dishes whet their appetite.)

806
00:29:25,047 --> 00:29:26,255
I ate not so long ago,

807
00:29:26,256 --> 00:29:27,587
but it still whets my appetite.

808
00:29:28,617 --> 00:29:29,756
Try this.

809
00:29:29,926 --> 00:29:31,327
It's my first time eating it.

810
00:29:40,397 --> 00:29:41,996
We'll leave before 45 minutes.

811
00:29:43,166 --> 00:29:45,137
(Okay, I got it.)

812
00:29:46,436 --> 00:29:49,176
(He can't stop eating.)

813
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:52,516
You eat so well.

814
00:29:53,676 --> 00:29:54,746
It's really delicious.

815
00:29:55,377 --> 00:29:56,716
- Let's go now.
- Let's go.

816
00:29:56,986 --> 00:29:57,986
To wash our hair.

817
00:29:57,987 --> 00:29:59,787
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you.

818
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:02,287
(Team Guys)

819
00:30:03,256 --> 00:30:06,656
Although we got it wrong, we did it as a team.

820
00:30:06,857 --> 00:30:08,126
Put your seatbelt on.

821
00:30:08,127 --> 00:30:09,966
- No stress.
- No stress.

822
00:30:10,996 --> 00:30:12,736
Of course. We got it wrong...

823
00:30:13,297 --> 00:30:14,897
without any stress.

824
00:30:16,006 --> 00:30:17,867
- This is good.
- It's unfortunate, but it's okay.

825
00:30:18,367 --> 00:30:20,476
We probably got it wrong again even if we had a reattempt card.

826
00:30:20,736 --> 00:30:21,736
I agree.

827
00:30:21,837 --> 00:30:23,576
- After answering...
- We had...

828
00:30:23,577 --> 00:30:25,106
all three fingers extended.

829
00:30:25,107 --> 00:30:26,445
(Justifying themselves endlessly)

830
00:30:26,446 --> 00:30:28,675
After winning Yesan A...

831
00:30:28,676 --> 00:30:30,386
(Yesan A: Daeungjeon Hall of Sudeoksa Temple)

832
00:30:30,387 --> 00:30:32,046
We can continue after putting them to sleep.

833
00:30:32,047 --> 00:30:33,887
- Okay.
- We have enough time.

834
00:30:35,587 --> 00:30:38,726
(They're moving after making a simple plan.)

835
00:30:40,327 --> 00:30:47,666
(Team Guys can't get over the shock from Seosan.)

836
00:30:51,067 --> 00:30:52,505
Getting a question wrong could...

837
00:30:52,506 --> 00:30:54,175
make us feel down and lose confidence.

838
00:30:54,176 --> 00:30:55,236
But it's okay.

839
00:30:55,377 --> 00:30:58,306
(Yes, there's stress.)

840
00:30:58,307 --> 00:30:59,716
Let's try to stay positive.

841
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:02,915
I'm more intuitive than you'd think.

842
00:31:02,916 --> 00:31:03,946
Okay.

843
00:31:04,186 --> 00:31:06,587
I imagine us going to Yesan A...

844
00:31:07,087 --> 00:31:08,886
and taking a lot of time there.

845
00:31:08,887 --> 00:31:11,356
- Then we'll go to Asan.
- We'll also put them to sleep.

846
00:31:11,357 --> 00:31:13,126
I think we'll get both of them right...

847
00:31:13,127 --> 00:31:14,596
and win in the end.

848
00:31:14,597 --> 00:31:15,665
And turn the tables?

849
00:31:15,666 --> 00:31:18,936
I felt some strong positive energy.

850
00:31:19,637 --> 00:31:21,165
What if they also get it wrong at Seosan?

851
00:31:21,166 --> 00:31:23,307
Then we're more likely to win.

852
00:31:23,637 --> 00:31:25,405
I'm sure they'll get it wrong in Seosan.

853
00:31:25,406 --> 00:31:26,976
They'll get it wrong even with the reattempt card.

854
00:31:27,277 --> 00:31:29,206
Whatever the problem may be, let's stay calm.

855
00:31:29,706 --> 00:31:30,946
Okay, that sounds good.

856
00:31:31,607 --> 00:31:33,846
No question would be more flustering than the question about fingers.

857
00:31:33,847 --> 00:31:34,847
Don't you agree?

858
00:31:36,446 --> 00:31:37,446
(Team Handsome)

859
00:31:37,447 --> 00:31:38,986
The hair salon is really big.

860
00:31:39,617 --> 00:31:40,655
Let's go.

861
00:31:40,656 --> 00:31:42,016
(For the shampoo assignment)

862
00:31:42,756 --> 00:31:45,925
(They called and made a reservation at a hair salon in Buyeo.)

863
00:31:45,926 --> 00:31:48,426
Hello. I'm sorry.

864
00:31:49,067 --> 00:31:50,326
Can we shampoo our hair?

865
00:31:50,327 --> 00:31:51,396
They must be startled.

866
00:31:51,397 --> 00:31:52,436
- Hello.
- Hello.

867
00:31:52,996 --> 00:31:54,366
Can we shampoo our hair?

868
00:31:54,367 --> 00:31:56,666
- Where can we wash our hair?
- Over there.

869
00:31:56,966 --> 00:31:58,036
Thank you.

870
00:31:58,037 --> 00:31:59,206
(Thank you for giving us your permission.)

871
00:31:59,406 --> 00:32:01,877
May we use this shampoo?

872
00:32:02,406 --> 00:32:04,975
Hey, Dong Hyun.

873
00:32:04,976 --> 00:32:06,416
- Yes?
- Don't change...

874
00:32:06,547 --> 00:32:08,715
the water temperature so suddenly to tease me.

875
00:32:08,716 --> 00:32:10,147
- Don't do that.
- Of course not.

876
00:32:10,246 --> 00:32:11,685
Don't do anything like that.

877
00:32:11,686 --> 00:32:13,116
- We don't have much time.
- Please do it quickly.

878
00:32:13,117 --> 00:32:14,185
Sure, I'll hurry.

879
00:32:14,186 --> 00:32:15,686
- This is for your neck.
- Okay.

880
00:32:16,887 --> 00:32:18,557
- Is that how you'll do it?
- Or he'll get wet.

881
00:32:19,196 --> 00:32:20,356
Right.

882
00:32:20,357 --> 00:32:21,755
Is this correct?

883
00:32:21,756 --> 00:32:23,827
The towel might get wet.

884
00:32:23,996 --> 00:32:26,935
This is incredible. He put the towel over here.

885
00:32:26,936 --> 00:32:28,866
- It should be around his shoulders.
- Exactly.

886
00:32:28,867 --> 00:32:30,037
- Right.
- Right.

887
00:32:30,436 --> 00:32:32,506
- This is my first time.
- Yes, I can see that.

888
00:32:32,976 --> 00:32:34,077
It looks like your first time.

889
00:32:34,137 --> 00:32:35,577
Does the water feel okay?

890
00:32:35,946 --> 00:32:37,246
Yes, it's great.

891
00:32:37,577 --> 00:32:39,847
- How long have you been working?
- Today is my first...

892
00:32:39,976 --> 00:32:41,376
- Today is your first day?
- Yes.

893
00:32:41,377 --> 00:32:42,985
- You're working for the first time?
- Yes.

894
00:32:42,986 --> 00:32:45,287
- You must be a part-timer.
- The water is getting cold.

895
00:32:45,887 --> 00:32:47,956
(Clenching his teeth)

896
00:32:48,117 --> 00:32:49,386
To prevent water from getting in the ears,

897
00:32:49,387 --> 00:32:50,786
put your hand behind and block the ear.

898
00:32:50,787 --> 00:32:52,287
- You must be the director.
- Yes.

899
00:32:52,426 --> 00:32:54,196
Cover the ear. That's good.

900
00:32:54,696 --> 00:32:56,266
Be careful not to put water in his eyes.

901
00:32:56,567 --> 00:32:57,995
From the bottom.

902
00:32:57,996 --> 00:32:58,996
That's it.

903
00:32:58,997 --> 00:33:00,435
This is good. You're good.

904
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:01,736
I did this much.

905
00:33:02,607 --> 00:33:04,067
If you live around here, you should come here.

906
00:33:04,206 --> 00:33:05,567
I'll take good care of you.

907
00:33:06,037 --> 00:33:08,107
Turn the water off to save water bills.

908
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:09,306
That's it.

909
00:33:09,307 --> 00:33:11,245
Sir, the shape of your head is beautiful.

910
00:33:11,246 --> 00:33:12,276
The shape of my head?

911
00:33:12,277 --> 00:33:14,317
I don't think it's that beautiful.

912
00:33:14,777 --> 00:33:15,847
I will...

913
00:33:16,186 --> 00:33:17,716
- give you a scalp massage.
- Nice.

914
00:33:18,387 --> 00:33:19,786
- Doesn't it feel good?
- Yes.

915
00:33:19,787 --> 00:33:22,386
- This part is very...
- It looks very refreshing.

916
00:33:22,387 --> 00:33:25,057
Don't you usually cover the eyes?

917
00:33:25,256 --> 00:33:26,425
- Actually, - I forgot.

918
00:33:26,426 --> 00:33:28,326
I don't cover the eyes when the client is handsome.

919
00:33:28,327 --> 00:33:29,327
- Really?
- Yes.

920
00:33:29,328 --> 00:33:30,526
They always cover my eyes.

921
00:33:30,527 --> 00:33:32,096
(That's strange.)

922
00:33:32,397 --> 00:33:35,397
Most of the time, they cover my eyes.

923
00:33:35,536 --> 00:33:37,865
The person who shampooed your hair...

924
00:33:37,866 --> 00:33:40,007
- didn't want to see you.
- Is that true?

925
00:33:40,306 --> 00:33:41,676
Do they not cover your eyes, Jae Hyeon?

926
00:33:41,677 --> 00:33:43,746
- I don't think so.
- Really?

927
00:33:43,877 --> 00:33:46,047
- Speaking of which...
- Do you know how they cover me?

928
00:33:46,817 --> 00:33:49,015
They cover my face like this.

929
00:33:49,016 --> 00:33:50,446
They cover me like this.

930
00:33:50,447 --> 00:33:51,546
- For you to breathe?
- Seriously.

931
00:33:51,547 --> 00:33:53,256
- So that you can breathe?
- This is how they cover me.

932
00:33:53,257 --> 00:33:54,257
(Laughing)

933
00:33:54,258 --> 00:33:56,427
- I'm serious.
- Stop lying.

934
00:33:57,286 --> 00:33:58,486
I'm serious.

935
00:33:58,487 --> 00:34:00,726
This is how they cover me as soon as I arrive.

936
00:34:01,397 --> 00:34:02,427
That's hilarious.

937
00:34:02,766 --> 00:34:05,096
- The ears should be clean.
- I see.

938
00:34:06,496 --> 00:34:07,496
Is it done now?

939
00:34:07,497 --> 00:34:09,165
The bubbles are still behind the ears. Is that okay?

940
00:34:09,166 --> 00:34:10,237
- It's fine.
- You're done.

941
00:34:10,366 --> 00:34:11,967
- Please get up slowly.
- Okay.

942
00:34:12,067 --> 00:34:14,036
- Thank you.
- The chair isn't coming up.

943
00:34:14,277 --> 00:34:16,646
Wash your hair again more meticulously.

944
00:34:16,647 --> 00:34:19,346
It's okay. This foam is harmless.

945
00:34:20,377 --> 00:34:21,546
(It's time to dry his hair.)

946
00:34:21,547 --> 00:34:23,286
We don't have time for this.

947
00:34:26,857 --> 00:34:28,416
Alternate between H and C air.

948
00:34:28,916 --> 00:34:30,225
- H and C air?
- That's right.

949
00:34:30,226 --> 00:34:31,256
(How cool was that lingo?)

950
00:34:31,257 --> 00:34:33,627
(Patience)

951
00:34:34,357 --> 00:34:35,865
- Sir.
- Should we style your hair?

952
00:34:35,866 --> 00:34:37,527
I'm good, but I can't see ahead.

953
00:34:39,136 --> 00:34:41,536
This is the famous hairstyle from "Star in My Heart."

954
00:34:42,166 --> 00:34:44,436
- The one worn by Ahn Jae Wook.
- Ahn Jae Wook? Okay, good.

955
00:34:45,007 --> 00:34:46,506
- We're done.
- Thank you.

956
00:34:46,507 --> 00:34:48,306
(They're done with the free shampoo card.)

957
00:34:48,677 --> 00:34:50,705
(Team Guys)

958
00:34:50,706 --> 00:34:52,716
There are a lot of people here.

959
00:34:52,717 --> 00:34:53,817
What is this place?

960
00:34:53,947 --> 00:34:55,885
- This place...
- No way.

961
00:34:55,886 --> 00:34:57,686
- It's a village.
- It must be a tourist spot.

962
00:34:59,357 --> 00:35:01,186
We must eat here, guys.

963
00:35:01,686 --> 00:35:03,756
I can sense our victory.

964
00:35:03,757 --> 00:35:05,086
I bet we'll be offered a deodeok set menu.

965
00:35:05,087 --> 00:35:06,156
(Hearty and homey restaurants greet them.)

966
00:35:06,157 --> 00:35:07,257
Don't ask me.

967
00:35:07,596 --> 00:35:10,265
- We're here.
- It's Sudeoksa Temple.

968
00:35:10,266 --> 00:35:12,325
(They arrive at the shopping district...)

969
00:35:12,326 --> 00:35:14,467
(in front of Sudeoksa Temple.)

970
00:35:16,806 --> 00:35:17,936
Open for 80 years.

971
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:20,075
Wild vegetables bibimbap.

972
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:22,006
- My gosh.
- I'd go crazy there.

973
00:35:22,007 --> 00:35:23,377
Check that out.

974
00:35:24,277 --> 00:35:26,676
Don't ask me. I was surprised by that restaurant.

975
00:35:26,677 --> 00:35:28,277
(Let's answer the quiz correctly and eat our meal!)

976
00:35:28,817 --> 00:35:30,786
- A pillow that'll have you faint.
- Aster leaves.

977
00:35:30,987 --> 00:35:31,987
(Laughing)

978
00:35:31,988 --> 00:35:33,087
Did you see that pillow?

979
00:35:33,487 --> 00:35:35,256
We should buy one of those.

980
00:35:35,257 --> 00:35:36,357
Pillows that'll have you faint.

981
00:35:36,826 --> 00:35:38,357
That's made for Dong Hyun.

982
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:43,027
(And traditional snacks!)

983
00:35:44,897 --> 00:35:46,466
We're allowed freebies, right?

984
00:35:46,467 --> 00:35:47,765
Freebies?

985
00:35:47,766 --> 00:35:49,165
- Thank you.
- Me too.

986
00:35:49,166 --> 00:35:50,435
- We're allowed freebies.
- Just the oranda.

987
00:35:50,436 --> 00:35:51,535
- It's good.
- Thank you.

988
00:35:51,536 --> 00:35:52,575
- Try this too.
- We're good.

989
00:35:52,576 --> 00:35:54,036
We shouldn't turn her down like that.

990
00:35:54,536 --> 00:35:55,536
Thank you.

991
00:35:55,537 --> 00:35:57,547
- Would you like more?
- No, I'm good. But thanks.

992
00:35:57,907 --> 00:35:59,345
Wait. Isn't this...

993
00:35:59,346 --> 00:36:01,317
- Take a look.
- Thank you.

994
00:36:01,677 --> 00:36:02,916
Come by sometime.

995
00:36:03,447 --> 00:36:04,447
Yi Kyung.

996
00:36:04,846 --> 00:36:05,885
We're allowed to take freebies.

997
00:36:05,886 --> 00:36:07,016
Well, I...

998
00:36:07,416 --> 00:36:09,116
I won't eat that either.

999
00:36:09,487 --> 00:36:13,996
(Then, allow me.)

1000
00:36:14,397 --> 00:36:15,556
Check out this place.

1001
00:36:16,166 --> 00:36:18,796
"Mount Deoksung..."

1002
00:36:18,797 --> 00:36:20,095
I know what that is.

1003
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:21,296
- "Sudeoksa Temple." - This place.

1004
00:36:21,297 --> 00:36:22,706
- It's...
- It's nice here.

1005
00:36:22,806 --> 00:36:23,967
Deoksung...

1006
00:36:25,467 --> 00:36:27,536
What's the female version of a young master?

1007
00:36:27,737 --> 00:36:28,737
Ma'am?

1008
00:36:29,036 --> 00:36:32,205
No, that's not what I meant. Young Man.

1009
00:36:32,206 --> 00:36:34,047
- Young Man?
- As in Young Man Deoksung.

1010
00:36:35,447 --> 00:36:37,047
- Is he a fortune-teller?
- Is he someone you know?

1011
00:36:37,147 --> 00:36:38,587
- Do you know him?
- No, I mean...

1012
00:36:39,047 --> 00:36:40,685
There's a story about him.

1013
00:36:40,686 --> 00:36:41,716
(Lady Deoksung and Young Man Sudeok)

1014
00:36:41,717 --> 00:36:42,726
Is it something you read earlier?

1015
00:36:43,286 --> 00:36:45,285
I read it earlier, but I brushed it off...

1016
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:46,955
because I knew it.

1017
00:36:46,956 --> 00:36:48,527
(He's from around here and must know about Sudeoksa Temple.)

1018
00:36:49,027 --> 00:36:50,165
(Sang Uk might play a huge part during the quiz.)

1019
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:51,427
- Right now...
- What was it?

1020
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:55,595
Do you see the water drop of victory?

1021
00:36:55,596 --> 00:36:58,766
(The water drop of victory that greets them?)

1022
00:36:59,407 --> 00:37:01,705
(The way to victory is giving off a good vibe.)

1023
00:37:01,706 --> 00:37:04,345
I can't believe how huge this place is.

1024
00:37:04,346 --> 00:37:06,146
The trip back to the car will be just as long.

1025
00:37:06,147 --> 00:37:09,346
(It's a long road ahead.)

1026
00:37:09,547 --> 00:37:10,885
- I love it.
- Goodness.

1027
00:37:10,886 --> 00:37:13,015
You said we had to look at everything.

1028
00:37:13,016 --> 00:37:14,157
(That earlier wasn't the actual entrance.)

1029
00:37:14,516 --> 00:37:16,526
We have to walk quite the distance.

1030
00:37:16,527 --> 00:37:18,226
There weren't any signs.

1031
00:37:19,056 --> 00:37:20,127
We're finally here.

1032
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:22,825
The Daeungjeon Hall...

1033
00:37:22,826 --> 00:37:23,896
(The Daeungjeon Hall should be here somewhere.)

1034
00:37:23,897 --> 00:37:26,837
I'm still going strong thanks to the snacks.

1035
00:37:26,866 --> 00:37:28,196
- The snacks?
- Yes.

1036
00:37:28,197 --> 00:37:29,666
Do you see the water drops of victory?

1037
00:37:29,967 --> 00:37:31,435
Just let it drop on you.

1038
00:37:31,436 --> 00:37:32,436
(Water drops of victory greet them once again.)

1039
00:37:32,437 --> 00:37:33,576
One got me.

1040
00:37:33,877 --> 00:37:35,236
(However...)

1041
00:37:35,237 --> 00:37:37,306
(Sighing)

1042
00:37:38,377 --> 00:37:41,346
Are you kidding me with this walk?

1043
00:37:43,047 --> 00:37:44,316
We should be given a hint for this.

1044
00:37:44,317 --> 00:37:47,015
We've been walking for 37 minutes already.

1045
00:37:47,016 --> 00:37:48,115
(That's a lie.)

1046
00:37:48,116 --> 00:37:49,325
(My gosh!)

1047
00:37:49,326 --> 00:37:50,556
Did you see me twist my ankles?

1048
00:37:50,927 --> 00:37:52,555
Did you see that? Remember that from earlier?

1049
00:37:52,556 --> 00:37:54,455
- The victorious...
- The victorious energy.

1050
00:37:54,456 --> 00:37:55,696
- A lucky twist of the ankle.
- That's right.

1051
00:37:55,697 --> 00:37:57,096
(What's that? Victorious energy)

1052
00:37:57,726 --> 00:37:58,896
This is grand.

1053
00:37:58,897 --> 00:38:00,595
We need to walk all the way up there.

1054
00:38:00,596 --> 00:38:01,797
(After the third gate, they see another gate.)

1055
00:38:04,067 --> 00:38:05,435
(The size of Sudeoksa Temple is out of this world.)

1056
00:38:05,436 --> 00:38:07,035
- This...
- I think this is it.

1057
00:38:07,036 --> 00:38:09,035
My butt has been lifted from the walk...

1058
00:38:09,036 --> 00:38:11,046
and it's almost touching my shoulder blade.

1059
00:38:11,047 --> 00:38:12,276
(His glutes are being greeted by his shoulder blades.)

1060
00:38:12,277 --> 00:38:13,446
(Coughing)

1061
00:38:13,447 --> 00:38:15,446
(Mixed with a cardio exercise)

1062
00:38:15,447 --> 00:38:16,447
Very good.

1063
00:38:18,886 --> 00:38:20,185
There's a monk.

1064
00:38:20,186 --> 00:38:21,186
(Someone awaits them by the fifth gate.)

1065
00:38:21,187 --> 00:38:22,257
He's waiting for us.

1066
00:38:22,686 --> 00:38:24,285
(Financial Director of Sudeoksa Temple)

1067
00:38:24,286 --> 00:38:25,886
(Monk Hyunjoong)

1068
00:38:26,257 --> 00:38:27,296
(Panting)

1069
00:38:27,297 --> 00:38:28,527
- Sir.
- Goodness.

1070
00:38:28,596 --> 00:38:29,825
You're on high ground.

1071
00:38:29,826 --> 00:38:32,495
I know it was quite an exhausting uphill walk.

1072
00:38:32,496 --> 00:38:34,336
- Hello.
- It's good to see you.

1073
00:38:34,337 --> 00:38:35,696
(The monk who will be their guide at Sudeoksa Temple)

1074
00:38:35,697 --> 00:38:36,706
- Hello.
- Hello.

1075
00:38:39,067 --> 00:38:41,806
- We...
- You must be exhausted.

1076
00:38:42,306 --> 00:38:43,447
We'd appreciate...

1077
00:38:44,047 --> 00:38:45,176
the sticker.

1078
00:38:45,177 --> 00:38:46,575
(Are you heading down?)

1079
00:38:46,576 --> 00:38:47,777
He wants a sticker for arriving here.

1080
00:38:48,177 --> 00:38:50,216
We should get a sticker for arriving here.

1081
00:38:50,217 --> 00:38:51,915
(Just say we correctly answered the question.)

1082
00:38:51,916 --> 00:38:54,455
What kind of a temple is Sudeoksa Temple...

1083
00:38:54,456 --> 00:38:56,325
and how was it built here?

1084
00:38:56,326 --> 00:38:57,326
(What kind of a place is the huge Sudeoksa Temple?)

1085
00:38:57,327 --> 00:39:00,995
Sudeoksa Temple was built during the Baekje period.

1086
00:39:00,996 --> 00:39:02,095
The Baekje period.

1087
00:39:02,096 --> 00:39:04,966
According to documents, Baekje had a total...

1088
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:06,737
of 12 temples.

1089
00:39:06,967 --> 00:39:09,805
Sudeoksa Temple is the only one that remains.

1090
00:39:09,806 --> 00:39:10,806
(Sudeoksa Temple, the only Baekje temple that stands)

1091
00:39:10,807 --> 00:39:12,776
Could we take a look at the Daeungjeon Hall?

1092
00:39:12,777 --> 00:39:15,205
Why not? We should go see it together.

1093
00:39:15,206 --> 00:39:16,476
- Sounds good.
- Shall we?

1094
00:39:18,607 --> 00:39:21,446
I can sense that we'll get a hint.

1095
00:39:21,447 --> 00:39:22,745
I have a good feeling about this place.

1096
00:39:22,746 --> 00:39:25,886
(Yesan A: Daeungjeon Hall of Sudeoksa Temple)

1097
00:39:26,357 --> 00:39:28,616
That is the Daeungjeon Hall.

1098
00:39:28,886 --> 00:39:30,526
- Can you see it?
- Is that the Daeungjeon Hall?

1099
00:39:30,527 --> 00:39:31,527
Yes.

1100
00:39:33,226 --> 00:39:35,157
Gosh, this is amazing.

1101
00:39:36,467 --> 00:39:38,796
(National treasure: Daeungjeon Hall of Sudeoksa Temple)

1102
00:39:38,797 --> 00:39:40,297
What do you think of the hall?

1103
00:39:40,567 --> 00:39:42,365
I can tell that it's old.

1104
00:39:42,366 --> 00:39:43,766
- It's grand.
- Of course.

1105
00:39:44,206 --> 00:39:47,635
The other buildings are old,

1106
00:39:47,636 --> 00:39:50,006
but the colors of the hall have faded.

1107
00:39:50,007 --> 00:39:53,575
- It's a heritage.
- The temple was found in the 600s.

1108
00:39:53,576 --> 00:39:57,447
Most of the buildings burned down during the Imjin War,

1109
00:39:57,516 --> 00:39:59,515
but this remains as it was.

1110
00:39:59,516 --> 00:40:03,257
(The only building that survived the war)

1111
00:40:03,657 --> 00:40:06,527
They say it was built in 1308.

1112
00:40:06,826 --> 00:40:08,296
- Did you say 1308?
- Yes.

1113
00:40:08,297 --> 00:40:10,966
The year it was built has been clearly documented.

1114
00:40:10,967 --> 00:40:12,225
It's been around for 700 years.

1115
00:40:12,226 --> 00:40:13,296
(It's the oldest building in Korea that has its date documented.)

1116
00:40:13,297 --> 00:40:15,435
In 1937,

1117
00:40:15,436 --> 00:40:18,535
when the building was pulled apart for restoration,

1118
00:40:18,536 --> 00:40:20,206
they found the construction plan.

1119
00:40:20,636 --> 00:40:24,975
The pillar was set on April 17, 1308.

1120
00:40:24,976 --> 00:40:26,476
(The pillar was set on April 17, 1308.)

1121
00:40:28,846 --> 00:40:31,115
(Wooden pillars of 700 years)

1122
00:40:31,116 --> 00:40:33,357
(You can touch and feel the time they endured.)

1123
00:40:33,817 --> 00:40:35,056
- No way.
- It's been around for 700 years.

1124
00:40:35,456 --> 00:40:37,555
It was built during the Baekje period,

1125
00:40:37,556 --> 00:40:39,256
but the architecture is that of Goryeo.

1126
00:40:39,257 --> 00:40:40,926
The unique style of Baekje architecture...

1127
00:40:40,927 --> 00:40:42,596
can be discovered.

1128
00:40:43,527 --> 00:40:45,325
- It's grand.
- What's more beautiful...

1129
00:40:45,326 --> 00:40:47,296
is the side of the Daeungjeon Hall.

1130
00:40:47,297 --> 00:40:49,766
(The highlight is the side of the building.)

1131
00:40:53,877 --> 00:40:55,136
It feels different.

1132
00:40:55,377 --> 00:40:57,006
- That's right.
- It's even grander from here.

1133
00:40:57,007 --> 00:40:59,816
Those are what you'd call entasis columns.

1134
00:40:59,817 --> 00:41:02,216
They're bulgier in the middle...

1135
00:41:02,217 --> 00:41:03,646
compared to the top or bottom.

1136
00:41:03,647 --> 00:41:05,486
(Entasis columns)

1137
00:41:05,487 --> 00:41:07,015
Doesn't the shape of the roof...

1138
00:41:07,016 --> 00:41:09,156
remind you of the Chinese character that means "human?"

1139
00:41:09,157 --> 00:41:11,226
- Yes.
- It's called a gable roof.

1140
00:41:12,056 --> 00:41:15,396
The front and back of the roof meet in the middle to form a ridge.

1141
00:41:15,397 --> 00:41:17,365
It's a very simple style.

1142
00:41:17,366 --> 00:41:18,626
They come together like so.

1143
00:41:18,627 --> 00:41:19,866
It's elegant too.

1144
00:41:20,096 --> 00:41:24,106
It doesn't lack anything nor does it need more.

1145
00:41:24,107 --> 00:41:25,107
Exactly.

1146
00:41:25,108 --> 00:41:27,906
(Goryeo, 1308, Daeungjeon Hall of Sudeoksa Temple)

1147
00:41:27,907 --> 00:41:30,706
(Joseon, 1617, Daeungjeon Hall of Gwallyongsa Temple)

1148
00:41:30,806 --> 00:41:33,415
The brackets between the pillars and roof...

1149
00:41:33,416 --> 00:41:35,515
were done in a column-top complex bracketing style.

1150
00:41:35,516 --> 00:41:37,717
The brackets are only on top of the pillars.

1151
00:41:38,047 --> 00:41:40,615
There's what you'd call the multi-bracketing style,

1152
00:41:40,616 --> 00:41:42,516
but this is how ours were made.

1153
00:41:43,087 --> 00:41:44,455
(Multi-bracketing style)

1154
00:41:44,456 --> 00:41:46,756
(Brackets are placed between pillars for a more extravagant style.)

1155
00:41:46,757 --> 00:41:50,197
(Joseon, 1666, Daeungjeon Hall Yongmunsa Temple)

1156
00:41:51,967 --> 00:41:55,436
(Now, they'll look at the structure inside.)

1157
00:41:56,636 --> 00:41:58,407
(In awe)

1158
00:41:59,237 --> 00:42:03,146
It's as if wooden pieces were inserted into place.

1159
00:42:03,147 --> 00:42:04,245
That's right.

1160
00:42:04,246 --> 00:42:05,906
And...

1161
00:42:05,907 --> 00:42:09,546
in places that need them, wooden nails are used.

1162
00:42:09,547 --> 00:42:11,446
All those centuries ago,

1163
00:42:11,447 --> 00:42:14,056
how did they carry the heavy pieces up there?

1164
00:42:14,456 --> 00:42:17,356
Back then, this was a project...

1165
00:42:17,357 --> 00:42:18,656
of great magnitude.

1166
00:42:18,657 --> 00:42:21,426
The space in total is about 162m².

1167
00:42:21,427 --> 00:42:22,495
- As in the hall?
- Yes.

1168
00:42:22,496 --> 00:42:25,896
Even in this day and age, it wouldn't be easy...

1169
00:42:25,897 --> 00:42:27,366
to create something this beautiful.

1170
00:42:31,737 --> 00:42:33,236
(Yesan A: Daeungjeon Hall of Sudeoksa Temple)

1171
00:42:33,237 --> 00:42:35,476
(Time for Quiz)

1172
00:42:35,706 --> 00:42:38,206
In front of the Daeungjeon Hall,

1173
00:42:38,746 --> 00:42:41,646
let's answer the question about Sudeoksa Temple.

1174
00:42:41,647 --> 00:42:42,647
(What about Sudeoksa Temple will they be asked about?)

1175
00:42:42,648 --> 00:42:43,885
I'm not stressed at all.

1176
00:42:43,886 --> 00:42:44,986
(They start off with smiles on their faces.)

1177
00:42:44,987 --> 00:42:46,217
Here's your question.

1178
00:42:46,616 --> 00:42:50,056
This is a word that was derived from Buddhism.

1179
00:42:51,157 --> 00:42:53,697
Your head will spin when hungry,

1180
00:42:54,197 --> 00:42:57,427
so you eat a little just to stay alert.

1181
00:42:57,666 --> 00:42:59,737
The word meant that or the food itself.

1182
00:43:00,397 --> 00:43:03,305
What is this that also means...

1183
00:43:03,306 --> 00:43:04,806
"dotting your heart?"

1184
00:43:09,806 --> 00:43:11,947
- What is it?
- Fasting.

1185
00:43:12,007 --> 00:43:13,346
Could it be "simmi?"

1186
00:43:13,677 --> 00:43:14,947
What's that word?

1187
00:43:16,647 --> 00:43:18,086
Let me see.

1188
00:43:18,087 --> 00:43:19,246
Does "sim" mean the heart?

1189
00:43:19,857 --> 00:43:22,686
Well, I can't give you the exact definition.

1190
00:43:22,757 --> 00:43:26,897
I can't put the meaning into words.

1191
00:43:27,297 --> 00:43:29,055
"Simmi."

1192
00:43:29,056 --> 00:43:30,066
(It's just a feeling.)

1193
00:43:30,067 --> 00:43:31,897
- Is it...
- It's "simmi."

1194
00:43:32,527 --> 00:43:34,297
Eating a little bit of food?

1195
00:43:35,936 --> 00:43:37,737
Staving off hunger or tasting.

1196
00:43:38,206 --> 00:43:39,436
Staving off hunger?

1197
00:43:39,737 --> 00:43:40,975
Did you say "tasting" since there were court ladies for that?

1198
00:43:40,976 --> 00:43:43,706
Yes, but I kind of ruled that out.

1199
00:43:44,177 --> 00:43:45,606
- Staving off hunger.
- Staving off hunger.

1200
00:43:45,607 --> 00:43:46,915
That sounds decent.

1201
00:43:46,916 --> 00:43:49,446
What do we have? Staving off hunger, starting point,

1202
00:43:49,447 --> 00:43:51,447
- simmi, tasting.
- Simmi, staving off, tasting.

1203
00:43:52,116 --> 00:43:53,615
When you dot one's heart,

1204
00:43:53,616 --> 00:43:54,956
you'd go like this.

1205
00:43:55,186 --> 00:43:56,385
(Laughing)

1206
00:43:56,386 --> 00:43:57,785
- That's why...
- Hence, staving off hunger?

1207
00:43:57,786 --> 00:43:59,225
You're no better.

1208
00:43:59,226 --> 00:44:01,095
- My battery is dead.
- Is it dead?

1209
00:44:01,096 --> 00:44:02,297
- My battery is dead.
- It's dead.

1210
00:44:02,596 --> 00:44:03,966
Let me spend some time alone.

1211
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:05,265
Yi Kyung will write these...

1212
00:44:05,266 --> 00:44:06,325
- and you should think of a word.
- Got it.

1213
00:44:06,326 --> 00:44:08,596
(Leaving the screen)

1214
00:44:09,337 --> 00:44:11,635
(Forlorn)

1215
00:44:11,636 --> 00:44:12,837
Sim...

1216
00:44:13,136 --> 00:44:14,476
No, that's not how we approach this.

1217
00:44:14,737 --> 00:44:15,976
That isn't right.

1218
00:44:16,277 --> 00:44:21,877
(All that's left is the smartest Yi Kyung.)

1219
00:44:22,476 --> 00:44:23,946
is this a Buddhist term...

1220
00:44:23,947 --> 00:44:27,116
that everyone would know when they heard it?

1221
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:29,456
- Yes. Everyone knows the word.
- Everyone would know.

1222
00:44:29,516 --> 00:44:31,325
I think it's an easy one.

1223
00:44:31,326 --> 00:44:32,757
- Yes.
- Right?

1224
00:44:33,956 --> 00:44:35,725
Because he said, "Dotting your heart."

1225
00:44:35,726 --> 00:44:37,397
But is this a Buddhist term?

1226
00:44:38,027 --> 00:44:40,366
Should I explain how I came up with it?

1227
00:44:40,436 --> 00:44:42,697
I couldn't interpret "Dotting your heart."

1228
00:44:42,797 --> 00:44:43,865
If a heart is "sim," and a dot is "jeom,"

1229
00:44:43,866 --> 00:44:44,935
it's simjeom.

1230
00:44:44,936 --> 00:44:47,737
But it should be done by eating.

1231
00:44:47,837 --> 00:44:49,636
Simjeom to jeomsim as in lunch.

1232
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:51,506
Lunch.

1233
00:44:51,507 --> 00:44:54,076
- Lunch makes sense.
- Right?

1234
00:44:54,277 --> 00:44:56,516
- I think it's lunch.
- I think it's lunch too.

1235
00:44:56,547 --> 00:44:57,946
All I can think of is lunch...

1236
00:44:57,947 --> 00:45:00,217
- after hearing that.
- The more I hear it,

1237
00:45:00,357 --> 00:45:02,555
it's among the three we mentioned beforehand.

1238
00:45:02,556 --> 00:45:04,286
- It has to be one of them.
- It has to be.

1239
00:45:05,627 --> 00:45:07,825
But it said to "dot your heart."

1240
00:45:07,826 --> 00:45:09,865
- Let's go with this one.
- Yes. I think it's right.

1241
00:45:09,866 --> 00:45:11,726
Let's get it and put them to sleep.

1242
00:45:11,797 --> 00:45:13,495
And go to Asan to read "the War Diary of Yi Sun Sin."

1243
00:45:13,496 --> 00:45:15,337
- Sure.
- Sure. Let's go.

1244
00:45:15,496 --> 00:45:18,705
- One, two, three. Lunch.
- Two, three. Lunch.

1245
00:45:18,706 --> 00:45:19,837
Lunch is correct.

1246
00:45:20,636 --> 00:45:21,806
Lunch is correct.

1247
00:45:22,076 --> 00:45:23,176
(Hugging)

1248
00:45:23,177 --> 00:45:24,205
Lunch is correct.

1249
00:45:24,206 --> 00:45:26,046
(What? Is that correct?)

1250
00:45:26,047 --> 00:45:27,777
Jeomsim, lunch, came from Buddhism?

1251
00:45:28,647 --> 00:45:29,745
Thank you.

1252
00:45:29,746 --> 00:45:31,245
- Was what I said correct?
- It's exactly as you said.

1253
00:45:31,246 --> 00:45:33,385
It's to put jeom, dot, in hearts, sim.

1254
00:45:33,386 --> 00:45:35,056
Hence, dotting a heart.

1255
00:45:35,456 --> 00:45:37,055
We wrote various things down...

1256
00:45:37,056 --> 00:45:38,627
and chose it after crossing it off twice.

1257
00:45:38,857 --> 00:45:40,996
Hey, Sang Uk. I have a gift for you.

1258
00:45:43,427 --> 00:45:45,495
(It's something that dots Sang Uk's heart.)

1259
00:45:45,496 --> 00:45:47,266
- It's eojuk, the fish porridge.
- Good.

1260
00:45:47,337 --> 00:45:48,995
- Here.
- Are we eating eojuk?

1261
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:51,106
We'll head to Asan after we have eojuk.

1262
00:45:51,107 --> 00:45:52,436
Should we to-go it and have it in the car?

1263
00:45:52,536 --> 00:45:53,806
You can't do that.

1264
00:45:54,237 --> 00:45:55,535
We'll win for sure, then.

1265
00:45:55,536 --> 00:45:58,306
We have eojuk in this dramatic situation.

1266
00:45:58,777 --> 00:46:00,745
- The Sudeoksa Temple.
- The Sudeoksa Temple.

1267
00:46:00,746 --> 00:46:05,943
(Yesan A: Daeungjeon Hall of Sudeoksa Temple)

1268
00:46:06,186 --> 00:46:08,317
(Team Handsome)

1269
00:46:08,487 --> 00:46:09,615
(After refreshing shampooing)

1270
00:46:09,616 --> 00:46:10,927
- Do you feel refreshed?
- Do you feel refreshed?

1271
00:46:12,027 --> 00:46:14,157
We'll go to Seosan now.

1272
00:46:14,257 --> 00:46:15,496
How long does it take?

1273
00:46:15,657 --> 00:46:17,366
It's 60km away. It's quite far.

1274
00:46:17,866 --> 00:46:19,365
- It'll take about an hour.
- I see.

1275
00:46:19,366 --> 00:46:21,567
(It'll take about 1 hour.)

1276
00:46:21,797 --> 00:46:23,567
If we occupy Seosan,

1277
00:46:23,837 --> 00:46:25,206
we'll complete the bingo.

1278
00:46:25,907 --> 00:46:28,935
Their cuckoo alarm didn't go off since it did at 12pm.

1279
00:46:28,936 --> 00:46:31,976
It'll be over once we occupy Seosan.

1280
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:33,817
It means they got it wrong, doesn't it?

1281
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:36,376
It's highly likely that they got it wrong.

1282
00:46:36,377 --> 00:46:37,486
Right?

1283
00:46:37,487 --> 00:46:40,756
That means it's highly likely that we'll get it wrong too.

1284
00:46:40,757 --> 00:46:42,357
It means the quiz is that hard.

1285
00:46:42,556 --> 00:46:44,027
We should have saved a card.

1286
00:46:44,527 --> 00:46:45,586
That's right.

1287
00:46:45,587 --> 00:46:47,596
In that case, we'd won for sure.

1288
00:46:47,857 --> 00:46:50,567
We were about to lose, but now, we're on fire suddenly.

1289
00:46:50,697 --> 00:46:51,866
With the multiplication.

1290
00:46:51,967 --> 00:46:53,566
Right. That multiplication.

1291
00:46:53,567 --> 00:46:56,666
I was so happy when I knew it was multiplication.

1292
00:46:57,536 --> 00:46:58,806
I was so happy.

1293
00:46:59,436 --> 00:47:02,806
It's like when a good student study hard for an exam,

1294
00:47:02,877 --> 00:47:05,205
and he knows all the questions when he gets the exam paper.

1295
00:47:05,206 --> 00:47:06,447
He solves them fast.

1296
00:47:06,616 --> 00:47:08,845
- This is why people study.
- Yes.

1297
00:47:08,846 --> 00:47:10,016
That was exactly how it felt like.

1298
00:47:11,717 --> 00:47:14,686
Hey. If we win by completing the bingo,

1299
00:47:14,956 --> 00:47:17,087
- we'd win a reattempt card.
- Yes.

1300
00:47:17,527 --> 00:47:19,555
- It's tempting.
- I'll win it for you.

1301
00:47:19,556 --> 00:47:20,696
(The bingo benefit is tempting.)

1302
00:47:20,697 --> 00:47:21,756
I'm confident.

1303
00:47:21,757 --> 00:47:24,325
How are we going to use it, though? Should we wait until you come back?

1304
00:47:24,326 --> 00:47:26,366
No. I can give it to you.

1305
00:47:26,866 --> 00:47:28,865
They only give one card.

1306
00:47:28,866 --> 00:47:32,806
You can use it when you're on the same team.

1307
00:47:33,306 --> 00:47:35,876
- Right. We can use it then.
- Right.

1308
00:47:35,877 --> 00:47:37,277
- We should do that.
- Yes.

1309
00:47:37,447 --> 00:47:38,746
By the way,

1310
00:47:38,806 --> 00:47:40,676
I'm curious why they're not putting us to sleep.

1311
00:47:40,677 --> 00:47:43,416
I know. When we go to Seosan, it'll be over.

1312
00:47:43,487 --> 00:47:45,817
Why are they putting us to sleep? It's strange.

1313
00:47:46,857 --> 00:47:48,916
I didn't know a bingo game would be this tense.

1314
00:47:50,686 --> 00:47:53,596
What happens if the other team is in Seosan when we get there?

1315
00:47:53,857 --> 00:47:55,556
- We have to wait.
- Is that so?

1316
00:47:56,326 --> 00:47:58,427
Why am I so nervous? It's like the CSAT...

1317
00:47:58,797 --> 00:48:01,696
It's like as if I were going to check if I got into a college.

1318
00:48:01,697 --> 00:48:03,196
I'm more nervous than when I get a role.

1319
00:48:03,197 --> 00:48:04,866
(I'm more nervous than when I get a role.)

1320
00:48:05,666 --> 00:48:06,975
(A self-CPR)

1321
00:48:06,976 --> 00:48:08,406
Don't stop, my heart.

1322
00:48:08,407 --> 00:48:09,677
(A self-CPR)

1323
00:48:09,947 --> 00:48:11,106
(They get closer to the destination while calming their hearts.)

1324
00:48:11,107 --> 00:48:12,277
That's it.

1325
00:48:12,947 --> 00:48:14,746
When we take the curve...

1326
00:48:15,447 --> 00:48:17,086
- What?
- What?

1327
00:48:17,087 --> 00:48:18,286
Are they here again?

1328
00:48:19,686 --> 00:48:20,857
They're not here, right?

1329
00:48:21,516 --> 00:48:23,526
They're not here.

1330
00:48:23,527 --> 00:48:25,526
- They're not here, right? What?
- Are they here?

1331
00:48:25,527 --> 00:48:27,896
- No. It's a different car.
- They're not here.

1332
00:48:27,897 --> 00:48:32,566
(They were frightened out of their wits.)

1333
00:48:32,567 --> 00:48:34,936
Yes.

1334
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:38,606
(Team Handsome enters Seosan.)

1335
00:48:38,607 --> 00:48:40,007
It's so cool.

1336
00:48:42,806 --> 00:48:47,547
(New sentient beings are here.)

1337
00:48:47,717 --> 00:48:49,776
I have a feeling...

1338
00:48:49,777 --> 00:48:51,845
- that Dong Hyun will become a hero.
- I love that.

1339
00:48:51,846 --> 00:48:54,757
- Pardon?
- I have a feeling you'll be a hero.

1340
00:48:54,817 --> 00:48:58,556
The places we're studying for some time now...

1341
00:48:58,657 --> 00:49:00,396
are often dealt in the Korean History Proficiency Test.

1342
00:49:00,397 --> 00:49:01,796
- Really?
- All the time.

1343
00:49:01,797 --> 00:49:04,366
- Right. The Maitreya.
- Silla-Tang alliance and Maitreya.

1344
00:49:04,527 --> 00:49:05,967
They are all in the test.

1345
00:49:06,397 --> 00:49:07,535
(Surprised)

1346
00:49:07,536 --> 00:49:08,737
We have to climb quite a bit.

1347
00:49:13,536 --> 00:49:15,536
Gosh. It's so steep.

1348
00:49:17,306 --> 00:49:18,746
- Hello.
- Hello.

1349
00:49:19,047 --> 00:49:20,316
- I'm panting.
- Hello.

1350
00:49:20,317 --> 00:49:21,646
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

1351
00:49:21,647 --> 00:49:22,845
Hello.

1352
00:49:22,846 --> 00:49:24,986
Let me introduce myself. I'm Kim Jae Shin,

1353
00:49:24,987 --> 00:49:28,055
a tour guide of Seosan who will explain the place for you.

1354
00:49:28,056 --> 00:49:29,515
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

1355
00:49:29,516 --> 00:49:31,825
Shall we go and see the Smile of Baekje?

1356
00:49:31,826 --> 00:49:32,885
- Yes.
- Yes.

1357
00:49:32,886 --> 00:49:36,027
Gosh. How did they break and pile up all these stones?

1358
00:49:37,127 --> 00:49:39,297
Hey. I piled up the stones back in Jeju Island.

1359
00:49:39,397 --> 00:49:41,567
- Gosh. That must have been hard.
- Gosh. You're amazing.

1360
00:49:42,436 --> 00:49:43,636
Where is it? Goodness.

1361
00:49:44,136 --> 00:49:45,635
(Finally, it unfolds before Team Guys' eyes too.)

1362
00:49:45,636 --> 00:49:47,507
- What is that?
- That's it.

1363
00:49:48,237 --> 00:49:49,706
They made it on the stone.

1364
00:49:50,476 --> 00:49:51,676
That's...

1365
00:49:51,677 --> 00:49:53,305
This is the Smile of Baekje.

1366
00:49:53,306 --> 00:49:54,716
This is...

1367
00:49:54,717 --> 00:49:57,546
- always on the Korean History Test.
- Really?

1368
00:49:57,547 --> 00:50:00,055
- You have a certificate from it.
- The Smile of Baekje.

1369
00:50:00,056 --> 00:50:02,487
It's always on the test. Rock Trio Buddha...

1370
00:50:03,456 --> 00:50:06,226
The exact name is the Rock-Carved Triad Buddha.

1371
00:50:06,757 --> 00:50:08,257
Right. The Rock-Carved Triad Buddha.

1372
00:50:08,326 --> 00:50:10,765
- Can I tell you about it now?
- Yes.

1373
00:50:10,766 --> 00:50:13,265
This is National Treasure Number 84,

1374
00:50:13,266 --> 00:50:15,337
Rock-Carved Triad Buddha in Yonghyeon-ri, Seosan.

1375
00:50:16,467 --> 00:50:17,666
This is amazing.

1376
00:50:18,607 --> 00:50:22,507
The first one holding a marble is...

1377
00:50:22,576 --> 00:50:25,506
Dipankara, one of Buddhas from the past.

1378
00:50:25,507 --> 00:50:27,316
They're Triad Buddha of the past, present, and future.

1379
00:50:27,317 --> 00:50:28,947
"Maae" means carved rock.

1380
00:50:29,076 --> 00:50:32,116
When you go there, you can see they are all falling.

1381
00:50:32,217 --> 00:50:34,756
- From the 30 degrees-angle...
- Right. They look like this.

1382
00:50:34,757 --> 00:50:36,185
- Like Michael Jackson.
- That's...

1383
00:50:36,186 --> 00:50:37,256
Michael Jackson.

1384
00:50:37,257 --> 00:50:39,157
This carving technique is called a relief.

1385
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:41,357
It's more protruding than I thought.

1386
00:50:41,496 --> 00:50:43,466
- That's it for me.
- Thank you.

1387
00:50:43,467 --> 00:50:45,466
- I hope you'll get it right.
- Thank you.

1388
00:50:45,467 --> 00:50:47,535
Happy New Year. Thank you.

1389
00:50:47,536 --> 00:50:48,665
I want to get it right.

1390
00:50:48,666 --> 00:50:50,606
It was always on the Test.

1391
00:50:50,607 --> 00:50:51,866
Rock-Carved Triad Buddha.

1392
00:50:51,936 --> 00:50:53,265
- The alarm went off.
- Yesan A!

1393
00:50:53,266 --> 00:50:54,535
- What?
- What did it say?

1394
00:50:54,536 --> 00:50:55,736
Where?

1395
00:50:55,737 --> 00:50:56,845
(Cuckoo)

1396
00:50:56,846 --> 00:50:58,575
- Yesan A!
- Yesan A.

1397
00:50:58,576 --> 00:51:00,116
- It's right next to us.
- Where's the board?

1398
00:51:00,317 --> 00:51:03,116
- Then, they'll go to Asan.
- Here. They'll go to Asan now.

1399
00:51:03,786 --> 00:51:06,446
We have to get this quiz correctly...

1400
00:51:06,447 --> 00:51:08,555
- We have to go to Yesan.
- or go to Asan.

1401
00:51:08,556 --> 00:51:10,826
Also, before the quiz,

1402
00:51:11,087 --> 00:51:13,896
- we have to move back.
- We have to sleep.

1403
00:51:13,897 --> 00:51:15,196
We have to sleep.

1404
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:16,866
- Let's get going.
- We have to take a nap.

1405
00:51:17,567 --> 00:51:19,567
- Let's go and sleep.
- I was sleepy before.

1406
00:51:20,027 --> 00:51:22,496
I dozed off a bit, so I'm so awake now.

1407
00:51:23,636 --> 00:51:25,366
It's our first meal.

1408
00:51:25,766 --> 00:51:27,136
Eojuk. How tasty will it be?

1409
00:51:27,837 --> 00:51:29,877
- Gosh. It's cold.
- First, there's something...

1410
00:51:30,177 --> 00:51:32,206
Seung Ho wanted to do the most on the show.

1411
00:51:32,877 --> 00:51:35,317
He wants to use the card I picked...

1412
00:51:35,846 --> 00:51:37,616
to put the other team to sleep now.

1413
00:51:37,746 --> 00:51:39,146
Okay, Seung Ho.

1414
00:51:39,147 --> 00:51:40,186
(30-minute nap card)

1415
00:51:40,657 --> 00:51:42,686
You're right in front of me,

1416
00:51:42,817 --> 00:51:45,027
but I'm going to use the radio.

1417
00:51:45,257 --> 00:51:46,285
Go ahead.

1418
00:51:46,286 --> 00:51:48,427
This is not the right pose.

1419
00:51:48,726 --> 00:51:51,365
It doesn't matter whether they got Seosan or not.

1420
00:51:51,366 --> 00:51:52,666
It's right for us to use it now.

1421
00:51:53,366 --> 00:51:55,296
We should enjoy our meal comfortably before moving on.

1422
00:51:55,297 --> 00:51:56,366
(They use the nap card for a comfortable meal.)

1423
00:51:58,136 --> 00:51:59,606
(Crackling)

1424
00:51:59,607 --> 00:52:00,837
Producer.

1425
00:52:00,976 --> 00:52:02,107
Yes?

1426
00:52:03,677 --> 00:52:04,906
Put them to sleep.

1427
00:52:04,907 --> 00:52:06,646
(Acting cool)

1428
00:52:06,647 --> 00:52:07,717
Put them to sleep.

1429
00:52:08,746 --> 00:52:10,717
(A final touch)

1430
00:52:10,786 --> 00:52:12,346
You drop it from there to here.

1431
00:52:12,846 --> 00:52:15,217
Okay. We don't know what situation the other team is in.

1432
00:52:15,786 --> 00:52:17,427
- Cut. Okay.
- Okay.

1433
00:52:19,326 --> 00:52:20,656
(They're on their way to sleep.)

1434
00:52:20,657 --> 00:52:22,156
- Gosh.
- Goodness.

1435
00:52:22,157 --> 00:52:23,326
Why does it have to be now?

1436
00:52:24,297 --> 00:52:25,595
There's a brochure.

1437
00:52:25,596 --> 00:52:27,666
- You never know. We might get it.
- That's it, Tae Hyun.

1438
00:52:27,737 --> 00:52:28,996
You're so wise.

1439
00:52:29,967 --> 00:52:31,337
- What would it be?
- Gosh.

1440
00:52:32,206 --> 00:52:33,536
For goodness' sake.

1441
00:52:34,677 --> 00:52:37,276
Why am I hungry again?

1442
00:52:37,277 --> 00:52:41,516
(Each takes a spot while it's cramped in here.)

1443
00:52:41,616 --> 00:52:42,845
For goodness' sake.

1444
00:52:42,846 --> 00:52:45,516
(We do really take a nap.)

1445
00:52:47,516 --> 00:52:49,086
Okay. You'll sleep now.

1446
00:52:49,087 --> 00:52:51,356
The problem is the quiz is never from the part we studied.

1447
00:52:51,357 --> 00:52:52,456
(The nap starts.)

1448
00:52:53,386 --> 00:52:54,555
For goodness' sake.

1449
00:52:54,556 --> 00:52:55,896
(The lullaby comes on like always.)

1450
00:52:55,897 --> 00:52:57,126
Gosh. This song.

1451
00:52:57,127 --> 00:52:58,426
(The lullaby comes on like always.)

1452
00:52:58,427 --> 00:52:59,926
This song is really...

1453
00:52:59,927 --> 00:53:01,296
How many times did you hear the song?

1454
00:53:01,297 --> 00:53:03,706
- This is my 2nd or 3rd time.
- I'm hearing it for the 3rd time.

1455
00:53:03,866 --> 00:53:06,837
Isn't it too cruel I had to sleep 3 times out of 4 trips?

1456
00:53:08,306 --> 00:53:09,777
For goodness' sake.

1457
00:53:13,206 --> 00:53:15,217
The Smile of Baekje. Will it be "Smile back?"

1458
00:53:15,476 --> 00:53:17,785
- What is that?
- The Smile of Baekje.

1459
00:53:17,786 --> 00:53:19,115
- The question?
- Smile back.

1460
00:53:19,116 --> 00:53:20,316
- Come on.
- Is that the question?

1461
00:53:20,317 --> 00:53:21,515
Can I study?

1462
00:53:21,516 --> 00:53:23,856
No? He says we can't study.

1463
00:53:23,857 --> 00:53:24,955
(Stop studying and go to sleep.)

1464
00:53:24,956 --> 00:53:26,186
We're not allowed to study.

1465
00:53:26,226 --> 00:53:27,596
- We can't study?
- No.

1466
00:53:33,297 --> 00:53:35,866
(Team Handsome falls asleep before they know it.)

1467
00:53:37,366 --> 00:53:38,936
(Ringing)

1468
00:53:40,067 --> 00:53:41,276
For goodness' sake.

1469
00:53:41,277 --> 00:53:43,107
(Someone calls.)

1470
00:53:44,306 --> 00:53:45,846
- Gosh.
- Hello?

1471
00:53:46,476 --> 00:53:48,146
- Is it okay for you to take it?
- Yes.

1472
00:53:48,147 --> 00:53:49,447
(Laughing)

1473
00:53:51,186 --> 00:53:53,285
Please hold.

1474
00:53:53,286 --> 00:53:55,087
(Please hold.)

1475
00:53:58,087 --> 00:54:00,555
Someone called and asked if this place is open on Christmas.

1476
00:54:00,556 --> 00:54:02,196
(Laughing)

1477
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:04,266
- Is it open on Christmas?
- It's a real phone call.

1478
00:54:05,197 --> 00:54:06,826
- That's hilarious.
- In 20 minutes?

1479
00:54:06,897 --> 00:54:08,096
I had a good sleep.

1480
00:54:09,697 --> 00:54:11,765
I'm sorry, but the person in charge is not here right now.

1481
00:54:11,766 --> 00:54:13,467
Could you call back in 20 minutes?

1482
00:54:14,306 --> 00:54:15,677
Yes. Thank you.

1483
00:54:18,007 --> 00:54:19,547
Jae Hyeon handled it well.

1484
00:54:20,846 --> 00:54:22,746
I thought it was an updated part of the game.

1485
00:54:24,416 --> 00:54:27,156
(He finds it ridiculous too.)

1486
00:54:27,157 --> 00:54:28,556
To wake us up in the middle of the nap?

1487
00:54:28,786 --> 00:54:30,427
I thought it was a new way of waking us up.

1488
00:54:31,127 --> 00:54:32,656
- Enjoy.
- Thanks.

1489
00:54:32,657 --> 00:54:34,157
You can roll down the curtain.

1490
00:54:34,556 --> 00:54:36,157
Ma'am, please get us a bowl of rice.

1491
00:54:36,397 --> 00:54:37,496
- One?
- Yes.

1492
00:54:38,297 --> 00:54:39,927
When the food is served,

1493
00:54:40,436 --> 00:54:42,436
I'll have a bowl of rice first.

1494
00:54:42,536 --> 00:54:43,665
Gosh. This is homemade gochujang.

1495
00:54:43,666 --> 00:54:45,935
(Getting-ready pose)

1496
00:54:45,936 --> 00:54:47,535
I craved chili powder so much.

1497
00:54:47,536 --> 00:54:48,705
(Except for some snack,)

1498
00:54:48,706 --> 00:54:49,736
Gosh.

1499
00:54:49,737 --> 00:54:51,106
(they've been fasting for 9 hours.)

1500
00:54:51,107 --> 00:54:52,547
This even tastes great.

1501
00:54:54,246 --> 00:54:56,147
What is this, ma'am? Agar?

1502
00:54:56,416 --> 00:54:57,447
No.

1503
00:54:57,647 --> 00:54:59,546
I craved rice so much.

1504
00:54:59,547 --> 00:55:00,856
We need carbs.

1505
00:55:00,857 --> 00:55:03,115
(Getting ready to devour it)

1506
00:55:03,116 --> 00:55:04,385
Sang Uk, did you order yours only?

1507
00:55:04,386 --> 00:55:06,455
(Did you order yours only?)

1508
00:55:06,456 --> 00:55:07,527
- Did you want it too?
- Ma'am.

1509
00:55:07,757 --> 00:55:08,757
We'll have...

1510
00:55:08,757 --> 00:55:09,757
- Yi Kyung.
- I'm good.

1511
00:55:09,758 --> 00:55:10,765
One more rice, please.

1512
00:55:10,766 --> 00:55:12,797
Will you give one more rice first?

1513
00:55:15,496 --> 00:55:17,206
It's because you're athletes.

1514
00:55:17,967 --> 00:55:19,305
(Amazed)

1515
00:55:19,306 --> 00:55:20,576
It's already good when I only had the rice.

1516
00:55:21,976 --> 00:55:23,276
How long have we been fasting?

1517
00:55:23,277 --> 00:55:26,176
(The first rice of the day is amazing.)

1518
00:55:26,177 --> 00:55:28,147
- Thank you.
- Are you having rice already?

1519
00:55:28,547 --> 00:55:29,616
- Yes.
- Thank you.

1520
00:55:30,686 --> 00:55:32,186
Gosh. This tastes so good.

1521
00:55:33,916 --> 00:55:35,185
(Totally satisfied)

1522
00:55:35,186 --> 00:55:36,186
Yi Kyung.

1523
00:55:36,187 --> 00:55:39,326
(Totally satisfied)

1524
00:55:40,056 --> 00:55:41,156
It's like pickled radish.

1525
00:55:41,157 --> 00:55:42,196
(The side dishes have a crunchy texture since eojuk is soft.)

1526
00:55:42,197 --> 00:55:44,026
Yes. It's salted radish.

1527
00:55:44,027 --> 00:55:45,696
(The white kimchi filled with umami is fantastic too.)

1528
00:55:45,697 --> 00:55:46,897
Does the white kimchi taste good?

1529
00:55:48,467 --> 00:55:49,566
(Yes.)

1530
00:55:49,567 --> 00:55:51,406
- With these side dishes...
- You can eat rice, right?

1531
00:55:51,407 --> 00:55:52,606
Like this...

1532
00:55:52,607 --> 00:55:53,935
(I'll have a bite too.)

1533
00:55:53,936 --> 00:55:55,177
- I'll have it with just gochujang.
- Yes.

1534
00:55:56,976 --> 00:55:59,277
Gosh. The aged kimchi is crazy.

1535
00:56:00,416 --> 00:56:01,646
It's amazing, isn't it?

1536
00:56:01,647 --> 00:56:04,086
(Even though it's their first meal of the day, they love it.)

1537
00:56:04,087 --> 00:56:05,947
Hunger is the best sauce.

1538
00:56:06,516 --> 00:56:07,717
Gosh. It's really crazy.

1539
00:56:07,817 --> 00:56:13,226
(He's taking a big bite again.)

1540
00:56:16,197 --> 00:56:17,426
I'm proud and happy.

1541
00:56:17,427 --> 00:56:20,967
(He's proud of the younger brothers' appetite.)

1542
00:56:21,766 --> 00:56:23,765
You're amazing.

1543
00:56:23,766 --> 00:56:25,866
(I can give you that.)

1544
00:56:27,177 --> 00:56:31,546
I can see the presence of eojuk, the fish porridge, from afar.

1545
00:56:31,547 --> 00:56:33,075
(Now, it's time to try the main dish.)

1546
00:56:33,076 --> 00:56:34,915
I didn't know where the word lunch came from.

1547
00:56:34,916 --> 00:56:35,916
Right.

1548
00:56:38,087 --> 00:56:40,146
- Thank you.
- Yes. Enjoy.

1549
00:56:40,147 --> 00:56:41,157
- Okay.
- Thank you.

1550
00:56:41,556 --> 00:56:42,616
(Sprinkled with perilla seeds)

1551
00:56:43,157 --> 00:56:44,785
(Rice, noodles, and crucian carp)

1552
00:56:44,786 --> 00:56:46,726
(With warm eojuk, you can taste the 3 together.)

1553
00:56:47,556 --> 00:56:49,656
(Shall we enjoy it?)

1554
00:56:49,657 --> 00:56:51,826
Okay, my team. I was so happy today.

1555
00:56:52,567 --> 00:56:54,765
- Let's enjoy it gratefully.
- Thanks for the food.

1556
00:56:54,766 --> 00:56:56,066
Let's enjoy it and say...

1557
00:56:56,067 --> 00:56:57,336
- no stress.
- No stress.

1558
00:56:57,337 --> 00:56:59,407
- Okay.
- No stress.

1559
00:57:00,007 --> 00:57:01,236
Gosh. It has rice in it.

1560
00:57:01,237 --> 00:57:02,636
- It's even better.
- Yes. It's fish porridge.

1561
00:57:03,407 --> 00:57:04,407
(He tries the spicy broth first.)

1562
00:57:04,408 --> 00:57:06,246
You should cool it. It's really hot.

1563
00:57:07,916 --> 00:57:10,277
(Amazed)

1564
00:57:12,186 --> 00:57:16,016
(The base of the porridge is thick.)

1565
00:57:19,186 --> 00:57:21,156
It's red and tastes like base...

1566
00:57:21,157 --> 00:57:23,196
for yukgaejang or jang kalguksu.

1567
00:57:23,197 --> 00:57:24,466
It does look like jang kalguksu.

1568
00:57:24,467 --> 00:57:25,726
(It's looks like jang kalguksu similar to yukgaejang.)

1569
00:57:27,596 --> 00:57:29,265
After having just the desserts...

1570
00:57:29,266 --> 00:57:35,036
(It's so hot that the steam covers everything.)

1571
00:57:38,746 --> 00:57:42,716
(They cool it down slowly and eat it quickly.)

1572
00:57:42,717 --> 00:57:44,987
I can tell they make gochujang themselves...

1573
00:57:45,516 --> 00:57:47,147
because it's so tasty.

1574
00:57:48,886 --> 00:57:53,356
(Steaming hot)

1575
00:57:53,357 --> 00:57:54,955
(It's even blocking the camera.)

1576
00:57:54,956 --> 00:57:57,627
Gosh. It does give me strength.

1577
00:58:03,936 --> 00:58:04,936
(Amazed)

1578
00:58:05,436 --> 00:58:06,635
Since I'm having it after feeling cold,

1579
00:58:06,636 --> 00:58:08,805
- it feels like it's melting here.
- Yes. Seriously.

1580
00:58:08,806 --> 00:58:10,606
It feels like my cheekbones are defrosting.

1581
00:58:10,607 --> 00:58:13,246
(Their frozen bodies are melting slowly.)

1582
00:58:15,377 --> 00:58:16,846
The side dishes taste amazing.

1583
00:58:22,956 --> 00:58:24,386
(Amazed)

1584
00:58:29,326 --> 00:58:31,066
Both of you eat so well.

1585
00:58:31,067 --> 00:58:32,697
(The young ones on each side are fighting hard.)

1586
00:58:34,866 --> 00:58:38,166
(He adds rice to it.)

1587
00:58:39,436 --> 00:58:40,706
(Slurping)

1588
00:58:41,677 --> 00:58:42,677
(Slurping)

1589
00:58:42,678 --> 00:58:44,475
(The younger ones are serious about eating.)

1590
00:58:44,476 --> 00:58:46,107
The two of you on each side...

1591
00:58:47,877 --> 00:58:49,246
make me keep eating the food.

1592
00:58:50,817 --> 00:58:52,685
Gosh. Is this sakura shrimp?

1593
00:58:52,686 --> 00:58:53,846
The tiny shrimp.

1594
00:58:54,857 --> 00:58:55,886
It tastes so good.

1595
00:58:58,826 --> 00:59:00,126
These pickles are amazing.

1596
00:59:00,127 --> 00:59:01,157
(He acknowledges it.)

1597
00:59:02,556 --> 00:59:05,397
(The frown of the truth)

1598
00:59:05,996 --> 00:59:11,166
(Seung Ho drinks the eojuk without a word.)

1599
00:59:11,636 --> 00:59:14,636
Every side dish goes so well with eojuk.

1600
00:59:15,107 --> 00:59:17,906
Since eojuk is slurpy,

1601
00:59:17,907 --> 00:59:20,777
they serve onions, cucumbers, kimchi, and pickled radish.

1602
00:59:21,246 --> 00:59:23,816
All side dishes have crunchy texture.

1603
00:59:23,817 --> 00:59:24,846
Right.

1604
00:59:25,286 --> 00:59:30,015
(As Team Guys were hungry, they enjoy the food tremendously.)

1605
00:59:30,016 --> 00:59:31,087
It's really good.

1606
00:59:31,456 --> 00:59:32,656
It's been a while...

1607
00:59:32,657 --> 00:59:34,027
since I felt my facial muscles getting melted by food.

1608
00:59:38,866 --> 00:59:43,035
(Scraping)

1609
00:59:43,036 --> 00:59:46,666
(They finish eating by scraping the last bowl.)

1610
00:59:47,677 --> 00:59:49,677
- Gosh. I finished it.
- This was really the best.

1611
00:59:50,277 --> 00:59:51,676
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1612
00:59:51,677 --> 00:59:53,446
We'll go to Asan.

1613
00:59:53,447 --> 00:59:55,075
- "War Diary of Yi Sun Sin." - Ma'am, thank you so much.

1614
00:59:55,076 --> 00:59:57,647
(Team Handsome)

1615
00:59:58,346 --> 01:00:02,487
(They're in deep sleep.)

1616
01:00:03,416 --> 01:00:07,157
(It's been 30 minutes since they started taking a nap.)

1617
01:00:08,056 --> 01:00:10,527
(Waking up)

1618
01:00:11,366 --> 01:00:12,796
The sleep is over now.

1619
01:00:12,797 --> 01:00:13,825
You can come out.

1620
01:00:13,826 --> 01:00:15,067
- Tae Hyun.
- Yes.

1621
01:00:15,837 --> 01:00:17,936
Gosh. I can't believe I fell asleep.

1622
01:00:19,036 --> 01:00:21,205
(Woke up)

1623
01:00:21,206 --> 01:00:22,377
It's time.

1624
01:00:23,007 --> 01:00:24,476
- What?
- Let's go.

1625
01:00:25,047 --> 01:00:26,075
We can do it.

1626
01:00:26,076 --> 01:00:27,305
(The older ones are studying hard as soon as they woke up.)

1627
01:00:27,306 --> 01:00:28,846
Hey, when you look at this...

1628
01:00:29,616 --> 01:00:31,015
Where did you find the brochure?

1629
01:00:31,016 --> 01:00:33,217
- But it's hard to memorize.
- Maitreya Bodhisattva...

1630
01:00:33,447 --> 01:00:35,456
- Bodhisattva is not the problem.
- In meditation.

1631
01:00:35,817 --> 01:00:37,927
Putting his left leg on top of the other.

1632
01:00:38,657 --> 01:00:40,256
Gosh. This must be it.

1633
01:00:40,257 --> 01:00:41,495
(Team Handsome has a fantastic academic atmosphere.)

1634
01:00:41,496 --> 01:00:43,657
You take the Buddha in the middle. I'll take the Bodhisattva.

1635
01:00:43,996 --> 01:00:46,466
The one with the ball is Bodhisattva.

1636
01:00:46,467 --> 01:00:48,067
We're going all in with this one.

1637
01:00:48,337 --> 01:00:49,765
Aren't you going to take the quiz?

1638
01:00:49,766 --> 01:00:51,936
- We are.
- We're cramming.

1639
01:00:52,306 --> 01:00:53,665
We're going all in for this one.

1640
01:00:53,666 --> 01:00:55,635
(The one at the back should gather the answer sheets.)

1641
01:00:55,636 --> 01:00:57,846
- Gosh. I don't know.
- We're going all in.

1642
01:00:58,377 --> 01:00:59,507
We're cramming.

1643
01:01:00,846 --> 01:01:01,976
- Everyone.
- Yes.

1644
01:01:02,277 --> 01:01:04,546
I'll give you the quiz.

1645
01:01:04,547 --> 01:01:05,547
- Okay.
- Gosh.

1646
01:01:05,548 --> 01:01:06,615
(Time for Quiz)

1647
01:01:06,616 --> 01:01:07,657
Please.

1648
01:01:08,056 --> 01:01:10,486
From now on, you'll be disqualified if you turn around.

1649
01:01:10,487 --> 01:01:11,487
- Okay.
- I see.

1650
01:01:12,257 --> 01:01:14,197
- Turn and you'll be disqualified.
- Hold on.

1651
01:01:14,427 --> 01:01:16,856
The shape of two hands...

1652
01:01:16,857 --> 01:01:18,366
of the Buddha in the middle of Rock-Carved Triad Buddha...

1653
01:01:19,096 --> 01:01:21,166
- is different.
- Right.

1654
01:01:21,596 --> 01:01:23,697
- That's...
- The right hand...

1655
01:01:24,206 --> 01:01:27,205
The shape of the right hand means getting rid of...

1656
01:01:27,206 --> 01:01:29,476
all fears of sentient beings.

1657
01:01:29,877 --> 01:01:32,805
The shape of the left hand means...

1658
01:01:32,806 --> 01:01:34,246
granting all wishes of sentient beings.

1659
01:01:34,547 --> 01:01:35,746
- Time.
- Okay.

1660
01:01:36,147 --> 01:01:37,416
Time. Seriously.

1661
01:01:37,717 --> 01:01:39,047
What do you want us to do, then?

1662
01:01:39,186 --> 01:01:40,416
Do you want to do the hand shape?

1663
01:01:41,016 --> 01:01:42,016
Do it?

1664
01:01:42,017 --> 01:01:43,786
Don't tell me the three of us has to do the hand shape.

1665
01:01:43,956 --> 01:01:45,756
On the count of three, all three of you...

1666
01:01:45,757 --> 01:01:46,986
(On the count of three, copy the hands of standing stone Buddha.)

1667
01:01:46,987 --> 01:01:48,756
need to do the hand gesture of the standing stone Buddha,

1668
01:01:48,757 --> 01:01:51,095
which stands at the center of the Rock-Carved Triad Buddha.

1669
01:01:51,096 --> 01:01:52,996
Hold on. Do we do the both hands?

1670
01:01:53,266 --> 01:01:54,266
Yes.

1671
01:01:56,217 --> 01:01:57,217
(Team Guys)

1672
01:01:57,218 --> 01:01:59,518
We'll go to Asan!

1673
01:02:00,827 --> 01:02:02,387
I feel different about eojuk now.

1674
01:02:04,057 --> 01:02:05,156
Seriously.

1675
01:02:05,157 --> 01:02:06,498
(Amazed)

1676
01:02:06,827 --> 01:02:08,967
To exaggerate a little, I enjoyed it so much to the point I got angry.

1677
01:02:10,787 --> 01:02:12,217
Even the air tastes sweet.

1678
01:02:12,249 --> 01:02:13,979
(Though it was late, it was a satisfying meal.)

1679
01:02:14,282 --> 01:02:16,642
Since we're Team No Stress, it's annoyingly good.

1680
01:02:17,881 --> 01:02:19,052
That's stressful now.

1681
01:02:20,381 --> 01:02:22,221
No stress is stressful.

1682
01:02:22,222 --> 01:02:23,952
It's a happy stress.

1683
01:02:24,392 --> 01:02:25,790
It's good stress.

1684
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:26,991
(They head to Asan in a good mood.)

1685
01:02:26,992 --> 01:02:28,021
Good-stress.

1686
01:02:29,222 --> 01:02:31,532
By now, Team Handsome in Seosan...

1687
01:02:31,992 --> 01:02:34,601
must be stressed out with the fingers.

1688
01:02:35,862 --> 01:02:38,231
They took a nap for 30 minutes.

1689
01:02:38,831 --> 01:02:40,971
They must be on their way now.

1690
01:02:40,972 --> 01:02:42,170
They're on their way to Asan.

1691
01:02:42,171 --> 01:02:43,400
(They think Team Handsome is heading to Asan after losing Seosan.)

1692
01:02:43,401 --> 01:02:44,811
I love the nap card.

1693
01:02:45,472 --> 01:02:46,472
It's really useful.

1694
01:02:46,473 --> 01:02:47,641
We can drag them at a critical moment.

1695
01:02:47,642 --> 01:02:49,311
They need to shampoo their hair too.

1696
01:02:49,682 --> 01:02:51,051
If they get the question wrong in Asan,

1697
01:02:51,052 --> 01:02:52,311
we'll have a nice dilemma.

1698
01:02:52,782 --> 01:02:54,011
We can go to Yesan...

1699
01:02:54,012 --> 01:02:55,250
or win Asan and finish the game.

1700
01:02:55,251 --> 01:02:56,551
Either way, we'll bring the game...

1701
01:02:56,552 --> 01:02:57,850
- to an end.
- Right.

1702
01:02:57,851 --> 01:02:59,751
Our first choice is to come back to Yesan.

1703
01:03:00,421 --> 01:03:01,761
Because there's a key...

1704
01:03:01,762 --> 01:03:02,991
but we don't know if we'll get it right there.

1705
01:03:02,992 --> 01:03:05,031
- We can't be certain.
- We don't have to...

1706
01:03:05,032 --> 01:03:06,162
Sit and wait.

1707
01:03:06,392 --> 01:03:08,301
We also have the upper hand when it comes to taking more spots.

1708
01:03:08,302 --> 01:03:10,061
(Team No Stress is certain that they'll win.)

1709
01:03:10,662 --> 01:03:12,872
I felt the action. The perfection.

1710
01:03:13,831 --> 01:03:15,601
(Laughing)

1711
01:03:16,142 --> 01:03:17,201
Let's go.

1712
01:03:17,202 --> 01:03:20,071
(Will their perfect plan come true?)

1713
01:03:20,072 --> 01:03:22,011
On the count of three,

1714
01:03:22,012 --> 01:03:24,580
copy the hand gesture of the Buddha statue.

1715
01:03:24,581 --> 01:03:26,112
- For both hands?
- Yes.

1716
01:03:27,012 --> 01:03:28,222
I should've talked to them.

1717
01:03:28,822 --> 01:03:30,020
I know it perfectly.

1718
01:03:30,021 --> 01:03:31,021
- All right. Ten seconds.
- Do you know?

1719
01:03:31,022 --> 01:03:32,051
- I know it perfectly.
- Jae Hyeon, do you know?

1720
01:03:32,052 --> 01:03:33,521
- You have ten seconds.
- Hold on.

1721
01:03:33,622 --> 01:03:36,122
Jae Hyeon, please. I should've talked to you.

1722
01:03:36,722 --> 01:03:37,791
I mean...

1723
01:03:38,331 --> 01:03:40,230
Earlier, we talked about...

1724
01:03:40,231 --> 01:03:42,701
the sitting Buddha and the standing Buddha.

1725
01:03:42,702 --> 01:03:45,532
I even memorized the positions of both hands.

1726
01:03:46,671 --> 01:03:48,600
- The Abhaya mudra.
- Now...

1727
01:03:48,601 --> 01:03:50,000
The Varada mudra.

1728
01:03:50,001 --> 01:03:52,611
- I know all.
- Do you know what's really funny?

1729
01:03:52,612 --> 01:03:53,972
Over there,

1730
01:03:54,311 --> 01:03:55,981
I was making the exact gesture.

1731
01:03:56,682 --> 01:03:57,810
- The center one?
- Are you serious?

1732
01:03:57,811 --> 01:03:59,581
- The center one?
- Over there,

1733
01:03:59,612 --> 01:04:01,650
I looked at the statue...

1734
01:04:01,651 --> 01:04:03,421
and made the exact gesture.

1735
01:04:05,452 --> 01:04:07,822
(Looking carefully)

1736
01:04:12,691 --> 01:04:14,031
It goes like this.

1737
01:04:14,032 --> 01:04:15,600
Please. Hold on.

1738
01:04:15,601 --> 01:04:17,931
- Only Jae Hyeon needs to know.
- Here's the thing.

1739
01:04:17,932 --> 01:04:19,770
- The two of us know.
- We know.

1740
01:04:19,771 --> 01:04:21,801
- I know exactly what it is.
- I know as well.

1741
01:04:21,802 --> 01:04:24,201
But Jae Hyeon kept talking about the lotus blossoms...

1742
01:04:24,202 --> 01:04:26,440
- and flames.
- That's right.

1743
01:04:26,441 --> 01:04:28,511
- Eating the lotus blossoms...
- He talked about other things.

1744
01:04:28,512 --> 01:04:29,941
and medicines...

1745
01:04:31,751 --> 01:04:39,322
(Jae Hyeon was more serious than anyone.)

1746
01:04:39,421 --> 01:04:40,452
And...

1747
01:04:40,691 --> 01:04:44,021
He talked about it continuously as we came up here.

1748
01:04:44,061 --> 01:04:45,730
While Jae Hyeon works hard,

1749
01:04:45,731 --> 01:04:48,302
- he focuses on the wrong things.
- Please do well.

1750
01:04:48,501 --> 01:04:50,971
- Jae Hyeon, this is the last one.
- Jae Hyeon, please.

1751
01:04:50,972 --> 01:04:52,830
Jae Hyeon, it isn't that one.

1752
01:04:52,831 --> 01:04:54,400
It isn't the one with the crossed legs.

1753
01:04:54,401 --> 01:04:55,940
- Seriously.
- It's the one in the middle.

1754
01:04:55,941 --> 01:04:57,040
It's so...

1755
01:04:57,041 --> 01:04:58,111
- The pose is like...
- Let's begin.

1756
01:04:58,112 --> 01:04:59,170
It's very easy,

1757
01:04:59,171 --> 01:05:01,040
- It's like shooting out energy...
- Jae Hyeon.

1758
01:05:01,041 --> 01:05:02,911
- from the palms.
- Jae Hyeon.

1759
01:05:02,912 --> 01:05:03,940
- You know it, right?
- The thing is...

1760
01:05:03,941 --> 01:05:05,250
- Jae Hyeon.
- You know it, right?

1761
01:05:05,251 --> 01:05:08,080
- Hold on. I...
- It's a very easy question.

1762
01:05:08,081 --> 01:05:09,250
I can't remember one hand.

1763
01:05:09,251 --> 01:05:10,991
- Hey! That's the problem.
- Hey!

1764
01:05:10,992 --> 01:05:12,592
- Jae Hyeon.
- I'm not certain.

1765
01:05:13,722 --> 01:05:15,920
I can't remember one hand.

1766
01:05:15,921 --> 01:05:17,991
- I can't remember the right hand.
- The right hand?

1767
01:05:17,992 --> 01:05:19,130
I can't remember the right hand.

1768
01:05:19,131 --> 01:05:20,432
(He can't remember the right hand?)

1769
01:05:20,631 --> 01:05:22,830
- The right hand?
- You can't remember the right hand?

1770
01:05:22,831 --> 01:05:23,831
Let's begin.

1771
01:05:24,001 --> 01:05:26,531
- That means he has no idea.
- The right hand...

1772
01:05:26,532 --> 01:05:27,801
That means he has no idea.

1773
01:05:27,802 --> 01:05:29,701
- He has no idea.
- Please.

1774
01:05:29,702 --> 01:05:31,472
One, two, three.

1775
01:05:32,771 --> 01:05:34,441
One, two, three.

1776
01:05:35,941 --> 01:05:37,781
- Seriously.
- Incorrect.

1777
01:05:37,782 --> 01:05:39,452
- Incorrect.
- Please.

1778
01:05:40,052 --> 01:05:41,282
He's completely wrong.

1779
01:05:41,722 --> 01:05:43,121
- Look to the front.
- Please.

1780
01:05:43,122 --> 01:05:45,452
- Why? It's over.
- I should've told him.

1781
01:05:46,421 --> 01:05:48,321
- I should've told him.
- He's completely wrong.

1782
01:05:48,322 --> 01:05:50,161
- I was going to do that.
- He didn't remember the right hand,

1783
01:05:50,162 --> 01:05:51,191
so there was no hope.

1784
01:05:52,392 --> 01:05:53,991
- The first attempt failed.
- What?

1785
01:05:53,992 --> 01:05:56,060
- Do we get another chance?
- Please look to the front.

1786
01:05:56,061 --> 01:05:57,931
- Please. Jae Hyeon.
- Please look to the front.

1787
01:05:57,932 --> 01:06:00,100
You saw it earlier, right?

1788
01:06:00,101 --> 01:06:01,770
- Forget about the lotus flowers.
- Jae Hyeon.

1789
01:06:01,771 --> 01:06:04,670
It was written there. The right leg and the left leg.

1790
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:05,810
It was there.

1791
01:06:05,811 --> 01:06:07,310
This is why I have the level five certificate in Korean history.

1792
01:06:07,311 --> 01:06:09,112
I memorized all three of them.

1793
01:06:09,512 --> 01:06:10,711
I'm serious.

1794
01:06:10,811 --> 01:06:13,881
- The first attempt failed.
- Please.

1795
01:06:14,012 --> 01:06:15,151
It's time for the second attempt.

1796
01:06:15,251 --> 01:06:17,281
- Do we get two attempts?
- Yes.

1797
01:06:17,282 --> 01:06:20,350
Discuss it among yourselves and submit one answer.

1798
01:06:20,351 --> 01:06:21,560
- What?
- What?

1799
01:06:21,561 --> 01:06:22,862
- What?
- Can we discuss it among ourselves?

1800
01:06:22,921 --> 01:06:24,932
- I thought it was over.
- The hand gesture.

1801
01:06:25,262 --> 01:06:26,662
- Can we discuss it among ourselves?
- Yes.

1802
01:06:26,932 --> 01:06:29,560
- Hey, it's over.
- We don't need to discuss it.

1803
01:06:29,561 --> 01:06:30,830
- Can I show it to him?
- Yes.

1804
01:06:30,831 --> 01:06:32,231
- My goodness.
- It's over.

1805
01:06:32,302 --> 01:06:34,971
(A lesson on the hand gesture)

1806
01:06:34,972 --> 01:06:36,201
This is it. I remember.

1807
01:06:36,202 --> 01:06:38,541
- Three fingers, right?
- Three fingers.

1808
01:06:38,811 --> 01:06:40,340
- Three fingers.
- Hold on.

1809
01:06:40,341 --> 01:06:43,010
- Don't do this. Put them together.
- What's this?

1810
01:06:43,011 --> 01:06:44,911
- It's this.
- What? Isn't it right?

1811
01:06:44,912 --> 01:06:47,680
- Put them together.
- Put them together.

1812
01:06:47,681 --> 01:06:48,681
- Hold on.
- The arm sticks to the body.

1813
01:06:48,682 --> 01:06:49,751
- Good.
- Good.

1814
01:06:49,752 --> 01:06:51,391
- Take off the gloves.
- Earlier, I was too...

1815
01:06:51,422 --> 01:06:52,791
What did you do earlier?

1816
01:06:52,792 --> 01:06:54,661
Stick the arm to the body just in case.

1817
01:06:54,662 --> 01:06:56,521
Hold on. Are you certain?

1818
01:06:57,122 --> 01:06:58,291
I'm certain.

1819
01:06:58,292 --> 01:07:00,230
This is the hand gesture we want.

1820
01:07:00,231 --> 01:07:02,361
- This is the Buddha on the right.
- That's right.

1821
01:07:02,362 --> 01:07:04,831
- This is the Buddha on the left.
- This is it.

1822
01:07:04,832 --> 01:07:07,001
- That's right. This is it.
- This is it.

1823
01:07:07,002 --> 01:07:09,371
- This, this, and this.
- In that case,

1824
01:07:09,372 --> 01:07:11,111
why don't the 3 of you do 1 Buddha each?

1825
01:07:11,112 --> 01:07:12,810
- Okay. I know.
- That sounds good.

1826
01:07:12,811 --> 01:07:14,171
- Do you know?
- I memorized the poses.

1827
01:07:14,172 --> 01:07:16,781
- The Buddha here...
- I memorized them all.

1828
01:07:16,782 --> 01:07:18,310
- Tae Hyun, look.
- Is it this one or this one?

1829
01:07:18,311 --> 01:07:20,881
It's this one. I memorized it.

1830
01:07:20,882 --> 01:07:23,081
- I'll do the pose of this Buddha.
- Then it's this one.

1831
01:07:23,082 --> 01:07:24,850
- That's right.
- Then it's this one.

1832
01:07:24,851 --> 01:07:26,051
I'll do the pose of this Buddha.

1833
01:07:26,551 --> 01:07:28,191
One, two, three.

1834
01:07:28,792 --> 01:07:30,122
Smile.

1835
01:07:31,832 --> 01:07:32,832
Correct.

1836
01:07:35,301 --> 01:07:37,760
I can't believe we did it.

1837
01:07:37,761 --> 01:07:38,831
(They recreated the hand gestures perfectly.)

1838
01:07:38,832 --> 01:07:40,300
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

1839
01:07:40,301 --> 01:07:41,541
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

1840
01:07:41,542 --> 01:07:42,600
(I'm proud of them.)

1841
01:07:42,601 --> 01:07:43,801
That was incredible.

1842
01:07:46,412 --> 01:07:47,840
- I'm sorry.
- That was incredible.

1843
01:07:47,841 --> 01:07:49,011
Look at them.

1844
01:07:50,112 --> 01:07:51,350
- I knew that you'd mess up...
- Why?

1845
01:07:51,351 --> 01:07:53,150
the moment you said that you didn't know the right hand.

1846
01:07:53,151 --> 01:07:55,322
- The right hand was like this.
- It was so simple.

1847
01:07:55,382 --> 01:07:57,121
You could see the right hand the most clearly.

1848
01:07:57,122 --> 01:07:58,690
But you said that you didn't know the right hand.

1849
01:07:58,691 --> 01:08:00,690
- I thought, "He'll get it wrong." - At the museum,

1850
01:08:00,691 --> 01:08:02,090
I asked the curator...

1851
01:08:02,091 --> 01:08:03,491
- what the Buddha was holding.
- Yes.

1852
01:08:03,492 --> 01:08:06,260
It was stuck in my head. The Buddha was holding something.

1853
01:08:06,261 --> 01:08:07,661
But you got this question...

1854
01:08:07,662 --> 01:08:09,600
- Tae Hyun.
- But you got this question wrong.

1855
01:08:09,601 --> 01:08:11,100
- It doesn't matter.
- How did you get it wrong?

1856
01:08:11,101 --> 01:08:12,632
- You studied so diligently.
- I...

1857
01:08:12,801 --> 01:08:15,571
I'm observant. Earlier, I noticed the elephant.

1858
01:08:15,572 --> 01:08:17,671
I'm quite observant. I notice everything.

1859
01:08:17,672 --> 01:08:19,912
- He told us not to look back.
- I was so surprised.

1860
01:08:20,612 --> 01:08:21,711
It was incredible.

1861
01:08:21,712 --> 01:08:22,882
(Cultural assets are lovely when you study it for a long time.)

1862
01:08:23,341 --> 01:08:25,711
- Shall we pose?
- Okay.

1863
01:08:25,712 --> 01:08:27,252
I don't think I'll forget it.

1864
01:08:27,282 --> 01:08:28,381
It was incredible.

1865
01:08:28,382 --> 01:08:31,150
(Seosan: Rock-Carved Triad Buddha)

1866
01:08:31,151 --> 01:08:32,650
(Seosan: Rock-Carved Triad Buddha)

1867
01:08:32,651 --> 01:08:33,850
This is amazing.

1868
01:08:33,851 --> 01:08:35,421
- We completed the bingo.
- The bingo. Hurry up.

1869
01:08:35,422 --> 01:08:37,061
Tae Hyun, receive the benefit card.

1870
01:08:37,591 --> 01:08:38,930
- The benefit.
- Tae Hyun.

1871
01:08:38,931 --> 01:08:40,690
Let's use it when we're the same team again.

1872
01:08:40,691 --> 01:08:42,401
That's right. We should use it together.

1873
01:08:42,702 --> 01:08:45,031
Team Handsome completed the bingo and won.

1874
01:08:45,032 --> 01:08:46,801
- This is incredible.
- Congratulations.

1875
01:08:46,872 --> 01:08:48,970
I want to know who will receive the penalty. Let's go and watch.

1876
01:08:48,971 --> 01:08:50,371
- Of course.
- That's the fun of it.

1877
01:08:50,372 --> 01:08:52,940
- Jae Hyeon.
- I'll come back next week.

1878
01:08:52,941 --> 01:08:54,140
Clear your schedule for Monday and Tuesday.

1879
01:08:54,141 --> 01:08:55,382
(Was the sinner promoted to a new regular?)

1880
01:08:55,681 --> 01:08:58,282
- Jae Hyeon.
- Join our team again.

1881
01:08:58,351 --> 01:08:59,680
I gained a junior.

1882
01:08:59,681 --> 01:09:00,781
(They happily set off to make fun of Team Guys.)

1883
01:09:00,782 --> 01:09:02,451
I gained a junior.

1884
01:09:02,452 --> 01:09:03,721
Thank you.

1885
01:09:04,622 --> 01:09:05,622
Thank you.

1886
01:09:06,521 --> 01:09:08,521
I think we'll get a question about "War Diary of Yi Sun Sin."

1887
01:09:08,992 --> 01:09:11,991
It could be something else about Admiral Yi Sun Sin...

1888
01:09:11,992 --> 01:09:14,462
because he has many achievements and famous sayings.

1889
01:09:14,962 --> 01:09:16,300
I think the question will be about that.

1890
01:09:16,301 --> 01:09:17,301
(Studying up "War Diary of Yi Sun Sin")

1891
01:09:17,601 --> 01:09:19,900
This place about Chungmugong Yi Sun Sin...

1892
01:09:19,901 --> 01:09:21,800
is in Asan, not Tongyeong.

1893
01:09:21,801 --> 01:09:23,800
He's from that region.

1894
01:09:23,801 --> 01:09:25,242
(Not knowing what happened, they prepare for the quiz.)

1895
01:09:29,011 --> 01:09:31,911
(They hear the song about getting off work.)

1896
01:09:31,912 --> 01:09:32,981
We're in trouble.

1897
01:09:33,311 --> 01:09:34,551
They got the Seosan square.

1898
01:09:34,822 --> 01:09:36,122
Did they get the quiz right?

1899
01:09:36,422 --> 01:09:38,220
- Let's give them a big hand.
- I acknowledge them.

1900
01:09:38,221 --> 01:09:42,322
(How did they achieve that feat?)

1901
01:09:42,492 --> 01:09:44,520
- A big hand.
- I acknowledge them.

1902
01:09:44,521 --> 01:09:45,560
Seriously.

1903
01:09:45,561 --> 01:09:47,161
Despite losing, we fought well.

1904
01:09:47,162 --> 01:09:48,532
Despite losing, we fought well. Seriously.

1905
01:09:49,532 --> 01:09:51,801
- How did they get the quiz right?
- Seriously.

1906
01:09:52,231 --> 01:09:53,970
- I think it's impressive.
- I'm curious.

1907
01:09:53,971 --> 01:09:56,471
- It's incredible.
- Did they use a reattempt card?

1908
01:09:56,771 --> 01:09:58,072
Did they use two there?

1909
01:09:58,641 --> 01:10:00,072
Perhaps they had the cards saved up.

1910
01:10:00,112 --> 01:10:02,541
They would've had a chance if they had two reattempt cards.

1911
01:10:02,542 --> 01:10:03,742
(Team Guys guesses that they used 2 reattempt cards.)

1912
01:10:04,912 --> 01:10:06,212
My goodness.

1913
01:10:06,481 --> 01:10:09,680
Although I lost, I don't feel upset.

1914
01:10:09,681 --> 01:10:12,851
- It's nice.
- The sun is setting beautifully.

1915
01:10:12,922 --> 01:10:16,020
The other team completed a bingo for the first time in a while.

1916
01:10:16,021 --> 01:10:17,021
(Everything is peaceful.)

1917
01:10:17,761 --> 01:10:19,662
What makes me afraid...

1918
01:10:20,091 --> 01:10:22,061
is that this beautiful, no-stress team will change...

1919
01:10:22,332 --> 01:10:23,332
due to the individual match.

1920
01:10:23,962 --> 01:10:25,831
The individual match will change things.

1921
01:10:25,832 --> 01:10:27,401
Let's keep things stress-free...

1922
01:10:27,502 --> 01:10:29,001
for this round as well.

1923
01:10:29,002 --> 01:10:30,201
- No stress.
- Of course.

1924
01:10:30,202 --> 01:10:31,412
- Let's smile.
- Okay.

1925
01:10:31,542 --> 01:10:34,441
(Team Guys drives as they dream of the stress-free ending.)

1926
01:10:35,481 --> 01:10:38,351
(Handsome Guys members gather to determine the 1 penalty-taker.)

1927
01:10:39,952 --> 01:10:41,112
All right.

1928
01:10:41,252 --> 01:10:42,452
We're here.

1929
01:10:43,322 --> 01:10:44,551
- Congratulations.
- It has been a while.

1930
01:10:45,521 --> 01:10:47,322
How did you get it right?

1931
01:10:47,521 --> 01:10:49,691
Tae Hyun, one, two, three.

1932
01:10:50,322 --> 01:10:51,831
(A cute ceremony of the winners)

1933
01:10:51,832 --> 01:10:53,632
We acknowledged your victory.

1934
01:10:53,832 --> 01:10:54,832
We acknowledged it.

1935
01:10:55,401 --> 01:10:57,032
We did all three buddhas' poses.

1936
01:10:57,231 --> 01:10:59,072
You knew all the poses.

1937
01:10:59,271 --> 01:11:00,671
- Yi Kyung.
- Yes, Tae Hyun?

1938
01:11:00,672 --> 01:11:02,770
It's the basics of a variety show.

1939
01:11:02,771 --> 01:11:05,671
Memorizing the poses is the basics.

1940
01:11:05,672 --> 01:11:07,111
No.

1941
01:11:07,112 --> 01:11:08,310
The two on either sides were memorable,

1942
01:11:08,311 --> 01:11:10,412
but the middle one's hands weren't. We tried so many things.

1943
01:11:11,311 --> 01:11:12,651
Did you fail even when you got another attempt?

1944
01:11:12,851 --> 01:11:14,881
We failed even when we agreed on one pose.

1945
01:11:14,882 --> 01:11:17,451
We didn't succeed in it at once. It was impossible.

1946
01:11:17,452 --> 01:11:20,451
He had no idea whatsoever.

1947
01:11:20,452 --> 01:11:21,991
He said that he couldn't remember the right hand.

1948
01:11:21,992 --> 01:11:23,760
It told me that whatever he remembered was meaningless.

1949
01:11:23,761 --> 01:11:24,792
I thought, "He'll get it wrong."

1950
01:11:24,832 --> 01:11:26,131
Did you use a hint card beforehand?

1951
01:11:26,132 --> 01:11:28,760
A hint card? We had hint cards,

1952
01:11:28,761 --> 01:11:30,101
but we used them up quickly.

1953
01:11:30,931 --> 01:11:32,900
- It was strange.
- How funny. Tae Hyun,

1954
01:11:32,901 --> 01:11:34,071
- you shampooed your hair.
- What?

1955
01:11:34,072 --> 01:11:35,301
I washed my hair right away.

1956
01:11:36,672 --> 01:11:38,671
I called right away.

1957
01:11:38,672 --> 01:11:40,971
I washed my hair in the neighborhood right away.

1958
01:11:41,011 --> 01:11:44,010
There was a reason why we got the quiz right.

1959
01:11:44,011 --> 01:11:45,612
You guys saved us.

1960
01:11:45,782 --> 01:11:47,211
- We saved you guys?
- Think about it.

1961
01:11:47,212 --> 01:11:49,581
We were like, "Why aren't they putting us to sleep?"

1962
01:11:49,582 --> 01:11:51,520
After we listened to the explanation,

1963
01:11:51,521 --> 01:11:53,851
the production crew told us to come down. We were put to sleep.

1964
01:11:53,922 --> 01:11:56,561
Since we had time, we read things like this.

1965
01:11:56,591 --> 01:11:59,362
It was right in front of us when we took a nap.

1966
01:11:59,632 --> 01:12:00,890
Listen.

1967
01:12:00,891 --> 01:12:02,901
(We thought that they'd take a nice nap!)

1968
01:12:02,962 --> 01:12:04,230
Look at the first line.

1969
01:12:04,231 --> 01:12:06,430
"The right leg rests on the left leg."

1970
01:12:06,431 --> 01:12:08,300
"The left hand is holding the ankle."

1971
01:12:08,301 --> 01:12:09,671
"The fingers of the right hand..."

1972
01:12:09,672 --> 01:12:13,440
I was like, "What is this information for?" I copied it.

1973
01:12:13,441 --> 01:12:16,411
So Tae Hyun and I...

1974
01:12:16,412 --> 01:12:19,081
thought about the poses.

1975
01:12:19,082 --> 01:12:21,081
If we hadn't put you guys to sleep,

1976
01:12:21,082 --> 01:12:22,821
- would you have gotten it wrong?
- We would've gotten it wrong.

1977
01:12:22,822 --> 01:12:25,122
- It was my idea.
- Seung Ho wanted to use it.

1978
01:12:25,792 --> 01:12:26,921
Put them to sleep.

1979
01:12:26,922 --> 01:12:29,791
(He did it in a cool way.)

1980
01:12:29,792 --> 01:12:31,891
I don't know what situation they're in.

1981
01:12:34,032 --> 01:12:36,031
You put us to sleep at the right time.

1982
01:12:36,032 --> 01:12:38,572
We shouldn't put them to sleep without thinking.

1983
01:12:39,771 --> 01:12:41,231
Today, we were on the same team as Jae Hyeon.

1984
01:12:41,502 --> 01:12:44,270
Jae Hyeon ran toward us in the beginning, right?

1985
01:12:44,271 --> 01:12:45,510
He's quite competitive.

1986
01:12:45,511 --> 01:12:47,810
However, he makes...

1987
01:12:47,811 --> 01:12:49,180
so many strange deductions.

1988
01:12:49,181 --> 01:12:50,581
(An unexpected charm)

1989
01:12:50,582 --> 01:12:52,151
I have a bad hunch.

1990
01:12:53,282 --> 01:12:55,252
But there's something nice about him. He doesn't eat.

1991
01:12:55,651 --> 01:12:58,020
- They're similar in that sense.
- They're similar.

1992
01:12:58,021 --> 01:12:59,122
I loved it.

1993
01:12:59,322 --> 01:13:01,822
Usually, he doesn't eat until 5pm in the evening.

1994
01:13:01,922 --> 01:13:04,021
(Why is that?)

1995
01:13:04,261 --> 01:13:05,462
I worried about it a lot.

1996
01:13:05,662 --> 01:13:08,361
I knew that Dong Hyun ate a lot.

1997
01:13:08,362 --> 01:13:09,731
I wasn't sure if I should team up with him.

1998
01:13:09,832 --> 01:13:13,100
I trusted his level-five certificate in Korean history.

1999
01:13:13,101 --> 01:13:14,101
It definitely shined today.

2000
01:13:14,102 --> 01:13:15,440
It shined a bit.

2001
01:13:15,441 --> 01:13:17,501
If it weren't for him...

2002
01:13:17,502 --> 01:13:18,971
- It shined a bit.
- Today...

2003
01:13:19,612 --> 01:13:21,140
Today, Jae Hyeon kept saying...

2004
01:13:21,141 --> 01:13:22,681
- that we had good energy.
- We had good energy.

2005
01:13:22,712 --> 01:13:24,712
By the way, the temple stay...

2006
01:13:24,981 --> 01:13:27,011
- begins at 2am or 3am.
- What?

2007
01:13:27,082 --> 01:13:28,651
When does the schedule begin?

2008
01:13:28,721 --> 01:13:30,782
If you aren't going, you don't need to know.

2009
01:13:30,851 --> 01:13:32,521
We need to tell Sang Uk.

2010
01:13:33,221 --> 01:13:34,321
Why?

2011
01:13:34,322 --> 01:13:36,621
- Sang Uk...
- He volunteered to get the penalty.

2012
01:13:36,622 --> 01:13:38,691
- I'm sorry, but Sang Uk...
- What?

2013
01:13:38,731 --> 01:13:40,430
- didn't even let us talk.
- He really wants the experience.

2014
01:13:40,431 --> 01:13:42,230
"Stay still. I'll take care of it."

2015
01:13:42,231 --> 01:13:43,900
He's the son of South Chungcheong Province...

2016
01:13:43,901 --> 01:13:45,532
and the youngest member of a good team.

2017
01:13:45,572 --> 01:13:46,701
- Yes.
- Really?

2018
01:13:46,702 --> 01:13:48,071
Tae Hyun, I know what Sang Uk is like.

2019
01:13:48,072 --> 01:13:49,270
He'll leave first.

2020
01:13:49,271 --> 01:13:51,711
He'll leave first after saying that.

2021
01:13:51,712 --> 01:13:54,010
He'll leave first after saying that. Just you watch.

2022
01:13:54,011 --> 01:13:55,140
- Seriously.
- He's right.

2023
01:13:55,141 --> 01:13:57,081
- You left first when Jin was here.
- Seriously.

2024
01:13:57,082 --> 01:13:59,150
- He left very first.
- He's right.

2025
01:13:59,151 --> 01:14:00,411
It'll be strange if I get it right.

2026
01:14:00,412 --> 01:14:03,282
(When they had a shoot in South Gyeongsang Province)

2027
01:14:03,721 --> 01:14:07,091
(His speed was exceptional from the start.)

2028
01:14:07,721 --> 01:14:09,321
(He answered correctly when they had a quiz for a penalty...)

2029
01:14:09,322 --> 01:14:10,922
(in South Jeolla Province.)

2030
01:14:11,391 --> 01:14:15,401
(He was lucky enough to avoid the 1-6th chance.)

2031
01:14:16,702 --> 01:14:19,300
Today, he's determined since he's in South Chungcheong Province.

2032
01:14:19,301 --> 01:14:20,571
Shall we begin?

2033
01:14:20,572 --> 01:14:22,172
- Shall we do that?
- What's the question?

2034
01:14:22,242 --> 01:14:24,571
- I'm so happy to watch this.
- Yes.

2035
01:14:24,572 --> 01:14:26,372
- This is so much fun.
- Let's watch.

2036
01:14:26,811 --> 01:14:30,680
Among the 3 members, we'll pick 1 member who'll be exempt...

2037
01:14:30,681 --> 01:14:32,810
- with the first question.
- No stress.

2038
01:14:32,811 --> 01:14:35,350
- No stress.
- Let's do it with a smile.

2039
01:14:35,351 --> 01:14:36,681
You're lying.

2040
01:14:36,822 --> 01:14:38,350
We've been this way all day long.

2041
01:14:38,351 --> 01:14:39,390
- Are you serious?
- We're serious.

2042
01:14:39,391 --> 01:14:41,621
You'll yield because you don't care who gets the penalty.

2043
01:14:41,622 --> 01:14:43,661
- Of course.
- We'll play fair.

2044
01:14:43,662 --> 01:14:44,822
That goes without saying.

2045
01:14:44,962 --> 01:14:46,131
Okay.

2046
01:14:46,132 --> 01:14:47,531
(If you say so)

2047
01:14:47,532 --> 01:14:50,701
Among the nine places we were supposed to visit,

2048
01:14:50,702 --> 01:14:52,930
- two places were left out.
- We didn't visit two places.

2049
01:14:52,931 --> 01:14:55,701
- Asan.
- Hyeonchungsa Shrine in Asan.

2050
01:14:55,702 --> 01:14:56,901
Just two places.

2051
01:14:58,242 --> 01:15:02,712
(Asan: Hyeonchungsa Shrine)

2052
01:15:03,882 --> 01:15:05,180
(A place that's dedicated...)

2053
01:15:05,181 --> 01:15:06,451
(to Admiral Yi Sun Sin's mind and achievements,)

2054
01:15:06,452 --> 01:15:09,622
(Asan's Hyeonchungsa Shrine)

2055
01:15:11,051 --> 01:15:13,220
("War Diary of Yi Sun Sin" is Admiral Yin Sun Sin's diary...)

2056
01:15:13,221 --> 01:15:15,321
(over the course of 7 years from 1592 to 1598.)

2057
01:15:15,322 --> 01:15:17,560
(It consists of 8 volumes which span from the Imjin War...)

2058
01:15:17,561 --> 01:15:19,832
(to right before his death at the Battle of Noryang.)

2059
01:15:20,931 --> 01:15:24,100
(Pilsa...)

2060
01:15:24,101 --> 01:15:27,430
(Jeuksaeng, pilsaeng jeuksa)

2061
01:15:27,431 --> 01:15:29,171
(Pilsa jeuksaeng, pilsaeng jeuksa.)

2062
01:15:29,172 --> 01:15:30,801
(Those who seek death shall live, those who seek life shall die.)

2063
01:15:35,181 --> 01:15:37,742
And the Yun Bong Gil Memorial Hall in Yesan.

2064
01:15:38,382 --> 01:15:41,681
(Yesan: Yun Bong Gil Memorial Hall)

2065
01:15:42,382 --> 01:15:46,391
(Yun Bong Gil Memorial Hall)

2066
01:15:47,551 --> 01:15:52,632
(A pocket watch he exchanged with Kim Gu before doing the deed)

2067
01:15:53,792 --> 01:15:57,361
(A handkerchief he held on to until the end)

2068
01:15:57,362 --> 01:16:01,231
(A seal)

2069
01:16:01,641 --> 01:16:05,771
(The place has Yun Bong Gil's mementos.)

2070
01:16:06,412 --> 01:16:10,840
("For my nation's independence, I won't fear death.")

2071
01:16:10,841 --> 01:16:12,582
We didn't go to those places.

2072
01:16:12,681 --> 01:16:15,520
I'll give you the question that would've been asked...

2073
01:16:15,521 --> 01:16:17,721
at the Hyeonchungsa Shrine in Asan.

2074
01:16:17,782 --> 01:16:18,952
Okay.

2075
01:16:19,521 --> 01:16:20,921
The national treasure...

2076
01:16:20,922 --> 01:16:22,361
you were supposed to see today, "War Diary of Yi Sun Sin,"

2077
01:16:22,362 --> 01:16:26,331
contains records of the war and daily life...

2078
01:16:26,332 --> 01:16:30,132
as well as Admiral Yi Sun Sin's emotions.

2079
01:16:30,431 --> 01:16:33,702
In particular, he often wrote about his longing for his mother.

2080
01:16:34,032 --> 01:16:35,271
That's right.

2081
01:16:35,301 --> 01:16:39,672
He also wrote about "Blank" of his generals and subordinates.

2082
01:16:40,011 --> 01:16:41,572
- What goes in the blank?
- Let me answer.

2083
01:16:41,612 --> 01:16:43,481
- Tendencies.
- Tendencies?

2084
01:16:43,981 --> 01:16:45,112
Incorrect.

2085
01:16:45,282 --> 01:16:46,680
Let me answer. Love?

2086
01:16:46,681 --> 01:16:48,050
Love? Incorrect.

2087
01:16:48,051 --> 01:16:50,351
That was a nice answer. No stress.

2088
01:16:50,651 --> 01:16:52,221
- It was cute.
- Let me answer.

2089
01:16:52,851 --> 01:16:54,221
- Names.
- Names?

2090
01:16:54,792 --> 01:16:55,922
- Incorrect.
- Let me answer.

2091
01:16:56,362 --> 01:16:57,861
Physical characteristics.

2092
01:16:57,862 --> 01:16:59,191
Physical characteristics? Incorrect.

2093
01:17:01,591 --> 01:17:04,400
No stress. I love that we're very calm.

2094
01:17:04,401 --> 01:17:06,332
- We're very calm.
- That's right. It's nice.

2095
01:17:07,271 --> 01:17:09,171
- We're very calm.
- Isn't it very serene?

2096
01:17:09,172 --> 01:17:10,241
- Yes.
- We played the game like this.

2097
01:17:10,242 --> 01:17:11,600
Amidst the calm atmosphere, I'd like to say...

2098
01:17:11,601 --> 01:17:13,112
that it's my turn now.

2099
01:17:13,971 --> 01:17:15,440
(I knew it.)

2100
01:17:15,441 --> 01:17:16,680
It has begun.

2101
01:17:16,681 --> 01:17:18,211
I thought we were raising hands.

2102
01:17:18,212 --> 01:17:20,281
You're stressed out. Okay. Shall we reset the game?

2103
01:17:20,282 --> 01:17:22,350
Shall I give those except for Yi Kyung a chance to answer?

2104
01:17:22,351 --> 01:17:24,121
- No, don't do that.
- No stress.

2105
01:17:24,122 --> 01:17:25,390
- No stress.
- No stress.

2106
01:17:25,391 --> 01:17:27,551
- Sang Uk. No stress.
- No stress.

2107
01:17:27,822 --> 01:17:29,122
Let's play fair.

2108
01:17:29,462 --> 01:17:31,832
Anyone can see that the competition is fierce.

2109
01:17:32,591 --> 01:17:35,701
(Afterward)

2110
01:17:35,702 --> 01:17:37,431
Let me answer. Worries.

2111
01:17:37,761 --> 01:17:39,672
Yi Kyung. Personal information.

2112
01:17:39,771 --> 01:17:42,571
- Sang Uk. Family relations.
- Family relations?

2113
01:17:42,572 --> 01:17:43,741
Let me answer.

2114
01:17:43,742 --> 01:17:45,042
- Memories.
- Memories?

2115
01:17:46,112 --> 01:17:48,640
- No stress.
- "I had dinner with them."

2116
01:17:48,641 --> 01:17:50,640
Hold on. Are our answers full of love today?

2117
01:17:50,641 --> 01:17:52,480
No stress.

2118
01:17:52,481 --> 01:17:54,011
How did you answer the previous questions?

2119
01:17:54,952 --> 01:17:56,122
How did we do that?

2120
01:17:56,782 --> 01:17:58,082
- It's hard.
- Let me answer.

2121
01:17:58,151 --> 01:17:59,421
You can't answer it.

2122
01:17:59,422 --> 01:18:01,451
(He shows his desire to answer the question.)

2123
01:18:01,452 --> 01:18:02,992
I feel like I'm in their predicament.

2124
01:18:03,691 --> 01:18:06,690
- You know, this quiz is hard.
- I know.

2125
01:18:06,691 --> 01:18:08,190
I was actually serious about...

2126
01:18:08,191 --> 01:18:09,761
- memories and love.
- That's right.

2127
01:18:10,132 --> 01:18:11,502
- What is it?
- What's the answer?

2128
01:18:12,072 --> 01:18:13,401
I want to answer it.

2129
01:18:13,601 --> 01:18:16,101
- I'll message the production crew.
- Same here.

2130
01:18:16,841 --> 01:18:19,412
Don't do that. There's no stress.

2131
01:18:19,542 --> 01:18:21,882
- Tell me if I'm correct.
- Will we get a correct answer?

2132
01:18:22,481 --> 01:18:24,411
(Yearly salary, tastes, addresses, advice)

2133
01:18:24,412 --> 01:18:25,451
(Incorrect)

2134
01:18:25,452 --> 01:18:26,452
Incorrect?

2135
01:18:26,453 --> 01:18:27,481
(Disappointed)

2136
01:18:27,882 --> 01:18:29,251
(Monthly salary, people who tormented him, debts,)

2137
01:18:29,252 --> 01:18:30,881
(colleagues, strategies)

2138
01:18:30,882 --> 01:18:32,621
(Incorrect)

2139
01:18:32,622 --> 01:18:33,850
It's hard.

2140
01:18:33,851 --> 01:18:35,051
(Focused)

2141
01:18:35,261 --> 01:18:36,760
(Tastes, monthly salary, relationship problems, evaluations)

2142
01:18:36,761 --> 01:18:39,090
(Incorrect)

2143
01:18:39,091 --> 01:18:40,891
- What's the answer?
- It's very hard.

2144
01:18:41,391 --> 01:18:43,230
- It's hard.
- I was serious with "Memories."

2145
01:18:43,231 --> 01:18:45,572
It's my turn again.

2146
01:18:45,832 --> 01:18:47,002
Again?

2147
01:18:47,332 --> 01:18:49,401
- Shall we receive a hint?
- Again?

2148
01:18:49,641 --> 01:18:51,702
- While we have Sang Uk...
- That's right.

2149
01:18:52,011 --> 01:18:53,111
I know the answer,

2150
01:18:53,112 --> 01:18:54,241
- but I'm keeping quiet.
- Is that so?

2151
01:18:54,242 --> 01:18:56,180
He's keeping quiet on purpose.

2152
01:18:56,181 --> 01:18:57,640
- I'll try to answer.
- Okay.

2153
01:18:57,641 --> 01:18:59,252
It'll look bad if you get it right.

2154
01:18:59,511 --> 01:19:00,752
We'll receive a hint then.

2155
01:19:01,382 --> 01:19:03,781
Please give us more details.

2156
01:19:03,782 --> 01:19:05,451
"War Diary of Yi Sun Sin..."

2157
01:19:05,452 --> 01:19:08,791
contains his thoughts regarding his fellow generals...

2158
01:19:08,792 --> 01:19:10,491
and subordinates.

2159
01:19:10,492 --> 01:19:11,560
What? Yi Kyung.

2160
01:19:11,561 --> 01:19:13,791
- Resolution?
- No.

2161
01:19:13,792 --> 01:19:15,800
Isn't it something like that? Ambition.

2162
01:19:15,801 --> 01:19:16,962
Strengths and weaknesses.

2163
01:19:17,401 --> 01:19:19,172
You got closer to the answer.

2164
01:19:19,872 --> 01:19:21,072
Let me answer.

2165
01:19:21,901 --> 01:19:23,241
Personal feelings.

2166
01:19:23,242 --> 01:19:24,470
(Personal feelings)

2167
01:19:24,471 --> 01:19:25,541
I think it's correct.

2168
01:19:25,542 --> 01:19:26,712
Incorrect.

2169
01:19:26,841 --> 01:19:30,542
(Tae Hyun submits another answer after hearing Seung Ho's answer.)

2170
01:19:32,011 --> 01:19:33,680
Did you get it right?

2171
01:19:33,681 --> 01:19:35,822
Why is he laughing so suddenly?

2172
01:19:35,981 --> 01:19:38,850
(Tae Hyun is correct.)

2173
01:19:38,851 --> 01:19:40,591
Seung Ho.

2174
01:19:41,091 --> 01:19:43,191
(Me? Why?)

2175
01:19:43,261 --> 01:19:45,292
(Everyone is curious.)

2176
01:19:45,431 --> 01:19:46,492
- I want to know.
- My goodness.

2177
01:19:47,362 --> 01:19:48,900
- Are we nearly there?
- Here's the thing.

2178
01:19:48,901 --> 01:19:52,600
- Today, your mind is too...
- Calm?

2179
01:19:52,601 --> 01:19:54,600
- No stress?
- Yes.

2180
01:19:54,601 --> 01:19:55,741
That's the problem.

2181
01:19:55,742 --> 01:19:58,510
Stick to your usual selves. Then you'll get the answer.

2182
01:19:58,511 --> 01:20:00,242
- Let me answer. Badmouthing?
- Correct.

2183
01:20:01,172 --> 01:20:02,941
- What was that?
- Correct.

2184
01:20:03,412 --> 01:20:05,981
Why did you guys come up with the strange concept?

2185
01:20:06,112 --> 01:20:09,681
Why did you guys dig your own graves?

2186
01:20:09,752 --> 01:20:12,422
- Badmouthing?
- Badmouthing.

2187
01:20:12,591 --> 01:20:15,151
Had we been competitive as usual,

2188
01:20:15,261 --> 01:20:17,462
we would've gotten "Badmouthing."

2189
01:20:17,561 --> 01:20:19,961
Had we been competitive as usual...

2190
01:20:19,962 --> 01:20:21,661
- That's right.
- It was hard.

2191
01:20:21,662 --> 01:20:23,961
You guys came up with the strange concept today.

2192
01:20:23,962 --> 01:20:26,300
They kept giving the good answers like "Memories" and "Love."

2193
01:20:26,301 --> 01:20:28,100
- That's right. We kept...
- It was so strange.

2194
01:20:28,101 --> 01:20:29,871
- We kept going in that direction.
- Was there too much romance?

2195
01:20:29,872 --> 01:20:32,471
I was serious about "Memories," "Romance," and "Love."

2196
01:20:32,511 --> 01:20:34,840
- What a strange concept.
- That was funny.

2197
01:20:34,841 --> 01:20:36,781
Seung Ho has a good hunch.

2198
01:20:36,782 --> 01:20:37,980
- Seung Ho.
- He's good.

2199
01:20:37,981 --> 01:20:39,382
- Okay. The last one.
- Seung Ho is good.

2200
01:20:39,782 --> 01:20:42,151
Wake up. One of them will get the penalty.

2201
01:20:42,851 --> 01:20:44,221
Here comes the last question.

2202
01:20:44,481 --> 01:20:46,521
This is from "War Diary of Yi Sun Sin."

2203
01:20:46,721 --> 01:20:49,720
It's a doodle that was drawn on the back...

2204
01:20:49,721 --> 01:20:53,132
of the Imjin entry that was written in 1592.

2205
01:20:53,332 --> 01:20:54,761
That's precious.

2206
01:20:55,332 --> 01:20:57,502
- Gosh, what's that?
- That's incredible.

2207
01:20:57,702 --> 01:21:01,201
Why did Admiral Yi Sun Sin make this doodle?

2208
01:21:01,202 --> 01:21:02,341
I think I know.

2209
01:21:03,271 --> 01:21:04,440
Sang Uk.

2210
01:21:04,441 --> 01:21:05,541
(Sang Uk gets a chance to answer.)

2211
01:21:05,542 --> 01:21:06,742
Sang Uk.

2212
01:21:06,912 --> 01:21:08,511
I think the doodle shows the sea...

2213
01:21:09,441 --> 01:21:11,141
and ships.

2214
01:21:11,212 --> 01:21:14,181
Isn't it a doodle that shows his plan to destroy all enemy ships?

2215
01:21:14,282 --> 01:21:16,781
- A plan for the war.
- Yes.

2216
01:21:16,782 --> 01:21:18,322
- Incorrect.
- Is it incorrect?

2217
01:21:19,691 --> 01:21:22,221
- Look. There are characters.
- There are characters.

2218
01:21:22,521 --> 01:21:24,261
They need to get it right.

2219
01:21:24,721 --> 01:21:26,332
Let's show them.

2220
01:21:27,792 --> 01:21:28,862
I want to answer.

2221
01:21:29,162 --> 01:21:30,600
I'll receive the penalty. Get the correct answer.

2222
01:21:30,601 --> 01:21:31,862
(I'll receive the penalty. Get the correct answer!)

2223
01:21:31,901 --> 01:21:33,101
I'll receive the penalty.

2224
01:21:33,872 --> 01:21:35,101
I'm serious.

2225
01:21:35,771 --> 01:21:38,742
I'll be good to Sang Uk since I'm the older brother.

2226
01:21:39,542 --> 01:21:40,941
Do you know the answer?

2227
01:21:41,141 --> 01:21:42,980
I'm not even looking at the doodle.

2228
01:21:42,981 --> 01:21:44,281
(He's innocent.)

2229
01:21:44,282 --> 01:21:47,011
(Moved)

2230
01:21:47,382 --> 01:21:48,582
If you know, answer right away.

2231
01:21:49,382 --> 01:21:51,551
- If you know, answer right away.
- Okay.

2232
01:21:51,851 --> 01:21:53,350
I'll receive the penalty.

2233
01:21:53,351 --> 01:21:54,492
(I'll receive the penalty!)

2234
01:21:55,521 --> 01:21:56,890
(Sang Uk becomes absorbed and makes deductions.)

2235
01:21:56,891 --> 01:21:58,362
He wants to say, "Let me answer."

2236
01:21:58,731 --> 01:22:00,331
There are many characters for "One."

2237
01:22:00,332 --> 01:22:01,361
(Why are they absorbed?)

2238
01:22:01,362 --> 01:22:02,800
- They won't answer the question.
- Seriously.

2239
01:22:02,801 --> 01:22:04,730
Why are they studying it?

2240
01:22:04,731 --> 01:22:05,901
(It's our quiz.)

2241
01:22:06,271 --> 01:22:07,601
Chinese characters.

2242
01:22:08,431 --> 01:22:10,300
Many of the same characters were used.

2243
01:22:10,301 --> 01:22:11,600
Can I try to answer?

2244
01:22:11,601 --> 01:22:13,141
- Can I try a random answer?
- Okay.

2245
01:22:14,941 --> 01:22:16,112
His signature.

2246
01:22:16,981 --> 01:22:19,011
If he signs for ten people...

2247
01:22:19,481 --> 01:22:20,810
Yi Kyung,

2248
01:22:20,811 --> 01:22:22,422
- you're correct.
- What did you say?

2249
01:22:22,981 --> 01:22:25,322
- Yi Kyung, you're correct.
- What did you say?

2250
01:22:25,721 --> 01:22:27,322
- I said, "His signature." - His signature.

2251
01:22:27,992 --> 01:22:29,221
- Is that his signature?
- Are you serious?

2252
01:22:29,691 --> 01:22:31,061
Is that his signature?

2253
01:22:31,561 --> 01:22:34,231
(Incredulous)

2254
01:22:35,032 --> 01:22:37,701
- I said, "The pen didn't work." - Are you serious?

2255
01:22:37,702 --> 01:22:38,970
- That's right.
- His signature.

2256
01:22:38,971 --> 01:22:40,300
That was my answer.

2257
01:22:40,301 --> 01:22:42,001
- Why?
- He was practicing.

2258
01:22:42,002 --> 01:22:43,671
That's right.

2259
01:22:43,672 --> 01:22:45,140
I thought it was too obvious.

2260
01:22:45,141 --> 01:22:46,940
(He didn't think that it'd be correct.)

2261
01:22:46,941 --> 01:22:48,712
- Are you serious?
- That's right.

2262
01:22:48,782 --> 01:22:50,111
- Is it the correct answer?
- Yes, it is.

2263
01:22:50,112 --> 01:22:52,811
- Did he practice his signature?
- He practiced his signature.

2264
01:22:53,452 --> 01:22:56,621
In the Joseon period, signatures were used to show...

2265
01:22:56,622 --> 01:22:59,021
that the document was checked by the person in charge.

2266
01:22:59,551 --> 01:23:02,721
It was called "Sugyeol."

2267
01:23:02,922 --> 01:23:05,931
Stamps could be forged easily, so signatures were used.

2268
01:23:07,032 --> 01:23:10,632
- So which one is his signature?
- Which one is it?

2269
01:23:11,301 --> 01:23:13,131
- Is it his signature?
- Yes.

2270
01:23:13,132 --> 01:23:16,041
(Admiral Yi Sun Sin's sugyeol, Ilsim)

2271
01:23:16,042 --> 01:23:17,202
Gosh.

2272
01:23:17,502 --> 01:23:19,371
Why do I feel bad?

2273
01:23:19,372 --> 01:23:20,572
- Why feel bad?
- It's okay.

2274
01:23:20,811 --> 01:23:22,111
It's because you don't know us!

2275
01:23:22,112 --> 01:23:23,112
Yi Kyung.

2276
01:23:23,113 --> 01:23:25,241
You're smiling quite broadly compared to how bad you feel.

2277
01:23:25,242 --> 01:23:26,480
I did get surprised.

2278
01:23:26,481 --> 01:23:28,851
We were able to get the answer.

2279
01:23:29,122 --> 01:23:30,651
It's okay. I live nearby.

2280
01:23:31,551 --> 01:23:32,551
But...

2281
01:23:32,552 --> 01:23:33,792
(Sighing)

2282
01:23:34,252 --> 01:23:36,090
Please give the youngest, Sang Uk, a round of applause.

2283
01:23:36,091 --> 01:23:37,091
Yes!

2284
01:23:37,092 --> 01:23:39,061
Sang Uk's temple stay! No stress!

2285
01:23:39,431 --> 01:23:40,491
No stress!

2286
01:23:40,492 --> 01:23:43,061
Temple stays are done to have no stress.

2287
01:23:43,362 --> 01:23:44,930
- Right.
- At 3am?

2288
01:23:44,931 --> 01:23:48,531
No matter how much stress you have, it will get relieved there.

2289
01:23:48,532 --> 01:23:49,641
(I might write a journal like Admiral Yi Sun Sin.)

2290
01:23:50,702 --> 01:23:53,872
(The peaceful day comes to an end.)

2291
01:23:55,042 --> 01:23:57,082
(Dawn at Sudeoksa Temple while it's still dark)

2292
01:23:57,712 --> 01:24:01,351
(Sang Uk pierces out through the darkness.)

2293
01:24:02,151 --> 01:24:03,151
Gosh.

2294
01:24:03,152 --> 01:24:04,452
(Tired)

2295
01:24:05,822 --> 01:24:06,851
The air feels great.

2296
01:24:09,391 --> 01:24:10,391
Hello.

2297
01:24:12,091 --> 01:24:13,931
(Buddhist meditation)

2298
01:24:14,391 --> 01:24:16,501
(A Buddhist practice for one to reach enlightenment...)

2299
01:24:16,502 --> 01:24:19,632
(by searching through themself)

2300
01:24:21,271 --> 01:24:22,701
It's my first time doing this.

2301
01:24:22,702 --> 01:24:23,801
(Cultivating his mind and body through Buddhist meditation)

2302
01:24:25,172 --> 01:24:26,641
I saw the hand of the statue as soon as I got here.

2303
01:24:27,341 --> 01:24:29,712
I lost because of that hand.

2304
01:24:32,212 --> 01:24:34,050
(Today's monk to save this miserable man has arrived!)

2305
01:24:34,051 --> 01:24:35,350
(Monk Cho Eun of Sudeoksa Temple)

2306
01:24:35,351 --> 01:24:36,721
Hello.

2307
01:24:37,481 --> 01:24:38,521
Hello.

2308
01:24:39,521 --> 01:24:41,322
Actually,

2309
01:24:42,021 --> 01:24:43,862
we're in the winter vassa period right now.

2310
01:24:44,061 --> 01:24:45,991
It's a period when we study zazen and Buddhist meditation...

2311
01:24:45,992 --> 01:24:48,761
all day long starting from the dawn of day.

2312
01:24:48,901 --> 01:24:51,261
Shall we start practicing this as well?

2313
01:24:51,862 --> 01:24:53,532
- I'm ready.
- Right.

2314
01:24:53,632 --> 01:24:55,201
This is the posture of Buddha.

2315
01:24:55,202 --> 01:24:57,141
It's called the lotus position.

2316
01:24:57,471 --> 01:25:01,141
One foot is placed on top of the thigh.

2317
01:25:01,572 --> 01:25:02,611
Right.

2318
01:25:02,612 --> 01:25:04,141
(Flapping)

2319
01:25:04,542 --> 01:25:05,550
Right.

2320
01:25:05,551 --> 01:25:06,650
(It seems quite awkward.)

2321
01:25:06,651 --> 01:25:08,550
Right. Lift it gently.

2322
01:25:08,551 --> 01:25:09,952
(The other foot is placed on the thigh as well.)

2323
01:25:10,122 --> 01:25:11,721
Try lifting it gently.

2324
01:25:13,551 --> 01:25:16,060
This is the most stable posture.

2325
01:25:16,061 --> 01:25:18,422
It's the lotus position...

2326
01:25:18,622 --> 01:25:20,391
that straightens your spine.

2327
01:25:21,761 --> 01:25:23,201
I'm struggling from here.

2328
01:25:23,202 --> 01:25:26,300
If you can't do it, just unlock your feet.

2329
01:25:26,301 --> 01:25:27,871
(Just unlock your feet.)

2330
01:25:27,872 --> 01:25:29,970
You have to sit in a comfortable posture.

2331
01:25:29,971 --> 01:25:30,971
Right.

2332
01:25:31,742 --> 01:25:33,971
Do you feel comfortable with your posture?

2333
01:25:34,042 --> 01:25:36,511
- Yes.
- We'll begin.

2334
01:25:37,811 --> 01:25:39,810
(With the clear sound of the keisaku,)

2335
01:25:39,811 --> 01:25:42,782
(the zazen begins.)

2336
01:25:43,651 --> 01:25:49,721
(Sang Uk closes his eyes and focuses on his inner self.)

2337
01:25:50,891 --> 01:25:54,191
(He remembers the past times he promised to have no stress.)

2338
01:25:54,962 --> 01:25:56,502
(Laughing)

2339
01:25:57,162 --> 01:25:58,831
(However, the moments of anguish came to him endlessly.)

2340
01:25:58,832 --> 01:26:03,002
(Keeping his eyes closed)

2341
01:26:03,341 --> 01:26:04,341
Yi Kyung.

2342
01:26:04,342 --> 01:26:05,711
(Yi Kyung who had called out for love and sacrifice...)

2343
01:26:05,712 --> 01:26:07,141
(has also left him.)

2344
01:26:07,771 --> 01:26:10,981
(He was full of stress last night.)

2345
01:26:15,851 --> 01:26:18,151
(After 30 minutes have passed,)

2346
01:26:19,322 --> 01:26:22,391
(the meditation ends with the keisaku.)

2347
01:26:22,761 --> 01:26:23,922
End with a bow.

2348
01:26:24,561 --> 01:26:25,561
Right.

2349
01:26:25,992 --> 01:26:27,561
- Let's move on then.
- Right.

2350
01:26:28,862 --> 01:26:30,532
This is the Wanwoldang.

2351
01:26:30,632 --> 01:26:32,230
- You see the leaves, right?
- Yes.

2352
01:26:32,231 --> 01:26:33,771
Let's sweep them up.

2353
01:26:34,032 --> 01:26:35,371
Just do it like this.

2354
01:26:35,372 --> 01:26:37,300
So it's done like this.

2355
01:26:37,301 --> 01:26:38,340
- Like this.
- This way.

2356
01:26:38,341 --> 01:26:39,372
Right.

2357
01:26:39,712 --> 01:26:41,411
- Keep them in one place.
- Okay. You should rest.

2358
01:26:41,412 --> 01:26:42,542
Okay.

2359
01:26:43,311 --> 01:26:45,651
(He works on his own with what he was taught.)

2360
01:26:46,481 --> 01:26:48,851
(He sweeps the leaves with the broom swiftly.)

2361
01:26:51,782 --> 01:26:52,821
It got stuck.

2362
01:26:52,822 --> 01:26:54,021
(He checks the leaves that are frozen to the ground too.)

2363
01:26:55,051 --> 01:26:56,462
They go in right away.

2364
01:26:58,622 --> 01:26:59,631
This is nice.

2365
01:26:59,632 --> 01:27:01,561
(His heart feels refreshed.)

2366
01:27:02,801 --> 01:27:03,801
It's nice and neat.

2367
01:27:03,801 --> 01:27:04,801
(Feeling proud)

2368
01:27:05,061 --> 01:27:07,771
(He puts away the tools that he used.)

2369
01:27:10,702 --> 01:27:12,371
(He finds the leaves he missed.)

2370
01:27:12,372 --> 01:27:13,771
Why are they here?

2371
01:27:15,341 --> 01:27:18,912
(The cleaning begins again in embarrassment.)

2372
01:27:20,811 --> 01:27:22,382
(A bunch of leaves)

2373
01:27:23,151 --> 01:27:24,350
(This time he works meticulously...)

2374
01:27:24,351 --> 01:27:28,952
(without missing any of them.)

2375
01:27:29,221 --> 01:27:31,121
You've worked hard, so you should have a cup of tea.

2376
01:27:31,122 --> 01:27:32,862
- That sounds great.
- Right.

2377
01:27:33,362 --> 01:27:34,362
- Thank you.
- Let's go.

2378
01:27:35,462 --> 01:27:37,100
- Enjoy your tea.
- Right.

2379
01:27:37,101 --> 01:27:38,132
Thank you.

2380
01:27:39,872 --> 01:27:43,600
(He takes a sip of the tea made by the monk.)

2381
01:27:43,601 --> 01:27:44,672
Is it okay?

2382
01:27:46,242 --> 01:27:47,242
It's delicious.

2383
01:27:47,243 --> 01:27:48,871
(A warmth that heats up the body that was cold from the cleaning)

2384
01:27:48,872 --> 01:27:51,481
I heard you were the world's best in fencing.

2385
01:27:52,042 --> 01:27:54,511
You must've worked so hard to achieve that position.

2386
01:27:55,151 --> 01:27:56,752
- It was tough.
- Right.

2387
01:27:57,122 --> 01:27:59,391
What was the toughest part?

2388
01:28:00,122 --> 01:28:01,492
More than the exercising,

2389
01:28:02,122 --> 01:28:04,992
it was tough because of the influence of others.

2390
01:28:05,162 --> 01:28:06,430
"You're definitely good."

2391
01:28:06,431 --> 01:28:08,662
This is what people think about me.

2392
01:28:10,002 --> 01:28:11,900
- These sorts of expectations.
- Right.

2393
01:28:11,901 --> 01:28:12,901
Right.

2394
01:28:13,471 --> 01:28:15,702
- You receive a lot of attention, - Right.

2395
01:28:16,072 --> 01:28:19,270
so I think you'll be going through a lot of mood swings.

2396
01:28:19,271 --> 01:28:20,912
- Yes. You are right.
- Right.

2397
01:28:21,112 --> 01:28:22,980
The evaluation of the people around you...

2398
01:28:22,981 --> 01:28:26,252
or the thoughts that you get from those influences...

2399
01:28:26,511 --> 01:28:28,282
feel like reality,

2400
01:28:28,452 --> 01:28:31,282
but they are only just the things that you feel.

2401
01:28:31,551 --> 01:28:34,520
You can't accept those things to be the truth.

2402
01:28:34,521 --> 01:28:37,462
- Right.
- The heart that loves your sport...

2403
01:28:37,721 --> 01:28:39,161
can't be damaged.

2404
01:28:39,162 --> 01:28:40,261
- Right?
- Yes.

2405
01:28:40,292 --> 01:28:43,462
Taking a step away from those things...

2406
01:28:43,561 --> 01:28:45,001
and being able to look at them...

2407
01:28:45,002 --> 01:28:46,631
is what meditation is.

2408
01:28:46,632 --> 01:28:47,672
Right.

2409
01:28:48,032 --> 01:28:51,172
At least once a day for ten minutes,

2410
01:28:52,042 --> 01:28:54,441
I think it is essential...

2411
01:28:54,641 --> 01:28:56,811
to be able to free yourself.

2412
01:28:57,282 --> 01:28:59,111
- "No stress." - Right.

2413
01:28:59,112 --> 01:29:01,881
I'm trying to think with this in mind.

2414
01:29:01,882 --> 01:29:02,882
Right.

2415
01:29:02,981 --> 01:29:05,681
But stress will always come.

2416
01:29:06,891 --> 01:29:09,792
It's important to let go of it quickly.

2417
01:29:10,322 --> 01:29:12,761
It would be great if you could learn to do that...

2418
01:29:12,891 --> 01:29:14,561
- Right.
- and put it into practice.

2419
01:29:15,292 --> 01:29:17,131
- Right. Good luck.
- Thank you.

2420
01:29:17,132 --> 01:29:18,132
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2421
01:29:18,702 --> 01:29:20,100
It was great to see you.

2422
01:29:20,101 --> 01:29:21,231
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

2423
01:29:22,802 --> 01:29:24,411
(Year 2025)

2424
01:29:25,254 --> 01:29:26,954
(For a greater leap in the Year of the Blue Snake,)

2425
01:29:26,955 --> 01:29:30,054
(Woo Sang Hyeok has arrived.)

2426
01:29:30,995 --> 01:29:32,724
(Today's Handsome Theme is people of the Year of the Snake.)

2427
01:29:33,794 --> 01:29:35,594
(Meet celebrities born in the Year of the Snake)

2428
01:29:35,794 --> 01:29:36,794
(It worked!)

2429
01:29:37,134 --> 01:29:38,893
(Jin Sun Kyu, 1977, Year of the Snake)
